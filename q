[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mBash  [22mis a command language interpreter that executes commands read from
       the standard input, from a string, or from a file.  It is a  reimplemen‐
       tation  and  extension  of the Bourne shell, the historical Unix command
       language interpreter.  [1mBash [22malso incorporates useful features  from  the
       [4mKorn[24m and [4mC[24m shells ([1mksh [22mand [1mcsh[22m).

       POSIX  is  the  name  for a family of computing standards based on Unix.
       [1mBash [22mis intended to be a conformant  implementation  of  the  Shell  and
       Utilities  portion  of  the  IEEE  POSIX  specification  (IEEE  Standard
       1003.1).  [1mBash [22mPOSIX mode (hereafter referred to as [4mposix[24m [4mmode[24m)  changes
       the  shell's behavior where its default operation differs from the stan‐
       dard to strictly conform to the standard.  See [1mSEE ALSO [22mbelow for a ref‐
       erence to a document that details how posix mode affects  [1mbash[22m's  behav‐
       ior.  [1mBash [22mcan be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       All  of the single-character shell options documented in the description
       of the [1mset [22mbuiltin command, including [1m-o[22m, can be used  as  options  when
       the  shell  is  invoked.  In addition, [1mbash [22minterprets the following op‐
       tions when it is invoked:

       [1m-c        [22mIf the [1m-c [22moption is present, then commands are read  from  the
                 first  non-option argument [4mcommand_string[24m.  If there are argu‐
                 ments after the [4mcommand_string[24m, the first argument is assigned
                 to [1m$0 [22mand any remaining arguments are assigned  to  the  posi‐
                 tional  parameters.  The assignment to [1m$0 [22msets the name of the
                 shell, which is used in warning and error messages.

       [1m-i        [22mIf the [1m-i [22moption is present, the shell is [4minteractive[24m.

       [1m-l        [22mMake [1mbash [22mact as if it had been invoked as a login shell  (see
                 [1mINVOCATION [22mbelow).

       [1m-r        [22mIf the [1m-r [22moption is present, the shell becomes [4mrestricted[24m (see
                 [1mRESTRICTED SHELL [22mbelow).

       [1m-s        [22mIf  the  [1m-s [22moption is present, or if no arguments remain after
                 option processing, the shell reads commands from the  standard
                 input.  This option allows the positional parameters to be set
                 when  invoking  an  interactive  shell  or  when reading input
                 through a pipe.

       [1m-D        [22mPrint a list of all double-quoted strings preceded by [1m$ [22mon the
                 standard output.  These are the strings that  are  subject  to
                 language  translation  when  the  current  locale  is not [1mC [22mor
                 [1mPOSIX[22m.  This implies the [1m-n [22moption; no commands will  be  exe‐
                 cuted.

       [1m[-+]O [[4m[22mshopt_option[24m[1m][0m
                 [4mshopt_option[24m is one of the shell options accepted by the [1mshopt[0m
                 builtin  (see  [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).  If [4mshopt_option[0m
                 is present, [1m-O [22msets the value of that option;  [1m+O  [22munsets  it.
                 If  [4mshopt_option[24m  is  not  supplied, [1mbash [22mprints the names and
                 values of the shell options accepted by [1mshopt [22mon the  standard
                 output.   If  the  invocation option is [1m+O[22m, the output is dis‐
                 played in a format that may be reused as input.

       [1m--        [22mA [1m-- [22msignals the end of options and  disables  further  option
                 processing.  Any arguments after the [1m-- [22mare treated as a shell
                 script  filename  (see  below)  and  arguments  passed to that
                 script.  An argument of [1m- [22mis equivalent to [1m--[22m.

       [1mBash [22malso interprets a number of multi-character options.  These options
       must appear on the command line before the single-character  options  to
       be recognized.

       [1m--debugger[0m
              Arrange  for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell
              starts.  Turns on extended debugging mode (see the description of
              the [1mextdebug [22moption to the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin below).

       [1m--dump-po-strings[0m
              Equivalent to [1m-D[22m, but the output  is  in  the  GNU  [4mgettext[24m  “po”
              (portable object) file format.

       [1m--dump-strings[0m
              Equivalent to [1m-D[22m.

       [1m--help [22mDisplay a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

       [1m--init-file [4m[22mfile[0m
       [1m--rcfile [4m[22mfile[0m
              Execute  commands from [4mfile[24m instead of the standard personal ini‐
              tialization file [4m~/.bashrc[24m if the shell is interactive (see [1mINVO‐[0m
              [1mCATION [22mbelow).

       [1m--login[0m
              Equivalent to [1m-l[22m.

       [1m--noediting[0m
              Do not use the GNU [1mreadline [22mlibrary to read  command  lines  when
              the shell is interactive.

       [1m--noprofile[0m
              Do  not  read either the system-wide startup file [4m/etc/profile[24m or
              any  of  the  personal  initialization   files   [4m~/.bash_profile[24m,
              [4m~/.bash_login[24m, or [4m~/.profile[24m.  By default, [1mbash [22mreads these files
              when it is invoked as a login shell (see [1mINVOCATION [22mbelow).

       [1m--norc [22mDo   not  read  and  execute  the  personal  initialization  file
              [4m~/.bashrc[24m if the shell is interactive.  This option is on by  de‐
              fault if the shell is invoked as [1msh[22m.

       [1m--posix[0m
              Enable  posix mode; change the behavior of [1mbash [22mwhere the default
              operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the standard.

       [1m--restricted[0m
              The shell becomes restricted (see [1mRESTRICTED SHELL [22mbelow).

       [1m--verbose[0m
              Equivalent to [1m-v[22m.

       [1m--version[0m
              Show version information for this instance of [1mbash [22mon  the  stan‐
              dard output and exit successfully.

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       If  arguments remain after option processing, and neither the [1m-c [22mnor the
       [1m-s [22moption has been supplied, the first argument is treated as  the  name
       of  a file containing shell commands (a [4mshell[24m [4mscript[24m).  When [1mbash [22mis in‐
       voked in this fashion, [1m$0 [22mis set to the name of the file, and the  posi‐
       tional  parameters  are  set to the remaining arguments.  [1mBash [22mreads and
       executes commands from this file, then exits.  [1mBash[22m's exit status is the
       exit status of the last command executed in the script.  If no  commands
       are  executed,  the  exit  status is 0.  [1mBash [22mfirst attempts to open the
       file in the current directory, and, if no file is  found,  searches  the
       directories in [1mPATH [22mfor the script.

[1mINVOCATION[0m
       A  [4mlogin[24m  [4mshell[24m is one whose first character of argument zero is a [1m-[22m, or
       one started with the [1m--login [22moption.

       An [4minteractive[24m [4mshell[24m is one started without non-option arguments (unless
       [1m-s [22mis specified) and without the [1m-c [22moption, and whose standard input and
       standard error  are  both  connected  to  terminals  (as  determined  by
       [4misatty[24m(3)), or one started with the [1m-i [22moption.  [1mBash [22msets [1mPS1 [22mand [1m$- [22min‐
       cludes  [1mi  [22mif  the  shell is interactive, so a shell script or a startup
       file can test this state.

       The following paragraphs describe how [1mbash [22mexecutes its  startup  files.
       If  any  of  the  files exist but cannot be read, [1mbash [22mreports an error.
       Tildes are expanded in filenames as described below under  [1mTilde  Expan‐[0m
       [1msion [22min the [1mEXPANSION [22msection.

       When [1mbash [22mis invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interac‐
       tive shell with the [1m--login [22moption, it first reads and executes commands
       from  the  file  [4m/etc/profile[24m,  if that file exists.  After reading that
       file, it looks for [4m~/.bash_profile[24m, [4m~/.bash_login[24m,  and  [4m~/.profile[24m,  in
       that  order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that ex‐
       ists and is readable.  The [1m--noprofile [22moption may be used when the shell
       is started to inhibit this behavior.

       When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login  shell
       executes the [1mexit [22mbuiltin command, [1mbash [22mreads and executes commands from
       the file [4m~/.bash_logout[24m, if it exists.

       When  an  interactive  shell  that is not a login shell is started, [1mbash[0m
       reads and executes commands from [4m~/.bashrc[24m, if that  file  exists.   The
       [1m--norc  [22moption  inhibits this behavior.  The [1m--rcfile [4m[22mfile[24m option causes
       [1mbash [22mto use [4mfile[24m instead of [4m~/.bashrc[24m.

       When [1mbash [22mis started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for exam‐
       ple, it looks for the variable [1mBASH_ENV [22min the environment, expands  its
       value  if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a
       file to read and execute.  [1mBash [22mbehaves as if the following command were
       executed:

              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi

       but does not use the value of the [1mPATH [22mvariable to search for the  file‐
       name.

       If  [1mbash  [22mis invoked with the name [1msh[22m, it tries to mimic the startup be‐
       havior of historical versions of [1msh [22mas closely as possible,  while  con‐
       forming  to  the POSIX standard as well.  When invoked as an interactive
       login shell, or a non-interactive shell  with  the  [1m--login  [22moption,  it
       first  attempts  to  read  and  execute  commands  from [4m/etc/profile[24m and
       [4m~/.profile[24m, in that order.  The [1m--noprofile [22moption inhibits this  behav‐
       ior.   When invoked as an interactive shell with the name [1msh[22m, [1mbash [22mlooks
       for the variable [1mENV[22m, expands its value if it is defined, and  uses  the
       expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute.  Since a shell
       invoked  as  [1msh  [22mdoes  not attempt to read and execute commands from any
       other startup files, the [1m--rcfile [22moption has no effect.  A  non-interac‐
       tive  shell  invoked with the name [1msh [22mdoes not attempt to read any other
       startup files.

       When invoked as [1msh[22m, [1mbash [22menters posix mode  after  reading  the  startup
       files.

       When [1mbash [22mis started in posix mode, as with the [1m--posix [22mcommand line op‐
       tion,  it  follows  the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode,
       interactive shells expand the [1mENV [22mvariable and read and execute commands
       from the file whose name is the expanded value.  No other startup  files
       are read.

       [1mBash  [22mattempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input
       connected to a network connection, as when executed  by  the  historical
       and  rarely-seen  remote shell daemon, usually [4mrshd[24m, or the secure shell
       daemon [4msshd[24m.  If [1mbash [22mdetermines it is being  run  non-interactively  in
       this  fashion,  it  reads  and executes commands from [4m~/.bashrc[24m, if that
       file exists and is readable.  [1mBash [22mdoes not read this file if invoked as
       [1msh[22m.  The [1m--norc [22moption inhibits this behavior, and the  [1m--rcfile  [22moption
       makes  [1mbash  [22muse a different file instead of [4m~/.bashrc[24m, but neither [4mrshd[0m
       nor [4msshd[24m generally invoke the shell with those options or allow them  to
       be specified.

       If  the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to
       the real user (group) id, and the [1m-p [22moption is not supplied, no  startup
       files  are read, shell functions are not inherited from the environment,
       the [1mSHELLOPTS[22m, [1mBASHOPTS[22m, [1mCDPATH[22m, and [1mGLOBIGNORE [22mvariables, if  they  ap‐
       pear  in  the environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is set
       to the real user id.  If the [1m-p [22moption is supplied  at  invocation,  the
       startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.

[1mDEFINITIONS[0m
       The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document.
       [1mblank  [22mA space or tab.
       [1mwhitespace[0m
              A character belonging to the [1mspace [22mcharacter class in the current

[1mRESERVED WORDS[0m
       [4mReserved[24m [4mwords[24m are words that have a special meaning to the shell.   The
       following  words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and either the
       first word of a command (see [1mSHELL GRAMMAR [22mbelow), the third word  of  a
       [1mcase  [22mor  [1mselect  [22mcommand (only [1min [22mis valid), or the third word of a [1mfor[0m

       [1m! case  coproc  do done elif else esac fi for function if in select then[0m
       [1muntil while { } time [[ ]][0m

[1mSHELL GRAMMAR[0m
       This section describes the syntax of the various  forms  of  shell  com‐
       mands.

   [1mSimple Commands[0m
       A [4msimple[24m [4mcommand[24m is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed
       by  [1mblank[22m-separated  words and redirections, and terminated by a [4mcontrol[0m
       [4moperator[24m.  The first word specifies the command to be executed,  and  is
       passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to
       the invoked command.

       The return value of a [4msimple[24m [4mcommand[24m is its exit status, or 128+[4mn[24m if the
       command is terminated by signal [4mn[24m.

   [1mPipelines[0m
       A [4mpipeline[24m is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the
       control operators [1m| [22mor [1m|&[22m.  The format for a pipeline is:

              [[1mtime [22m[[1m-p[22m]] [ ! ] [4mcommand1[24m [ [[1m|[22m⎪[1m|&[22m] [4mcommand2[24m ... ]

       The  standard output of [4mcommand1[24m is connected via a pipe to the standard
       input of [4mcommand2[24m.  This connection is performed before any redirections
       specified by the [4mcommand1[24m(see [1mREDIRECTION [22mbelow).  If [1m|& [22mis the pipeline
       operator, [4mcommand1[24m's standard error, in addition to its standard output,
       is connected to [4mcommand2[24m's standard input through the pipe; it is short‐
       hand for [1m2>&1 |[22m.  This implicit redirection of the standard error to the
       standard output is performed after any redirections  specified  by  [4mcom‐[0m
       [4mmand1[24m.

       The  return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command,
       unless the [1mpipefail [22moption is enabled.   If  [1mpipefail  [22mis  enabled,  the
       pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to
       exit  with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully.
       If the reserved word [1m!  [22mprecedes a pipeline, the  exit  status  of  that
       pipeline  is the logical negation of the exit status as described above.
       If a pipeline is executed synchronously, the shell waits  for  all  com‐
       mands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.

       If  the  [1mtime  [22mreserved  word precedes a pipeline, the shell reports the
       elapsed as well as user and system time consumed by its  execution  when
       the  pipeline  terminates.   The  [1m-p [22moption changes the output format to
       that specified by POSIX.  When the shell is in posix mode, it  does  not
       recognize  [1mtime  [22mas a reserved word if the next token begins with a “-”.
       The value of the [1mTIMEFORMAT [22mvariable is a format string  that  specifies
       how  the  timing information should be displayed; see the description of
       [1mTIMEFORMAT [22mbelow under [1mShell Variables[22m.

       When the shell is in posix mode, [1mtime [22mmay appear by itself as  the  only
       word  in  a  simple command.  In this case, the shell displays the total
       user and system time consumed by the shell and its children.  The  [1mTIME‐[0m
       [1mFORMAT [22mvariable specifies the format of the time information.

       Each  command  in  a multi-command pipeline, where pipes are created, is
       executed in a [4msubshell[24m, which is a separate process.  See [1mCOMMAND EXECU‐[0m
       [1mTION ENVIRONMENT [22mfor a description of subshells and a subshell  environ‐
       ment.   If  the  [1mlastpipe [22moption is enabled using the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin (see
       the description of [1mshopt [22mbelow), and job control is not active, the last
       element of a pipeline may be run by the shell process.

   [1mLists[0m
       A [4mlist[24m is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by  one  of  the
       operators  [1m;[22m, [1m&[22m, [1m&&[22m, or [1m||[22m, and optionally terminated by one of [1m;[22m, [1m&[22m, or
       [1m<newline>[22m.

       Of these list operators, [1m&& [22mand [1m|| [22mhave equal precedence, followed by  [1m;[0m
       and [1m&[22m, which have equal precedence.

       A  sequence  of  one  or more newlines may appear in a [4mlist[24m instead of a
       semicolon to delimit commands.

       If a command is terminated by the control operator [1m&[22m, the shell executes
       the command in the [4mbackground[24m in a subshell.  The shell  does  not  wait
       for  the  command  to finish, and the return status is 0.  These are re‐
       ferred to as [4masynchronous[24m commands.  Commands separated by a [1m; [22mare  exe‐
       cuted  sequentially;  the  shell  waits for each command to terminate in
       turn.  The return status is the exit status of  the  last  command  exe‐
       cuted.

       AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by the
       [1m&&  [22mand  [1m||  [22mcontrol operators, respectively.  AND and OR lists are exe‐
       cuted with left associativity.  An AND list has the form

              [4mcommand1[24m [1m&& [4m[22mcommand2[0m

       [4mcommand2[24m is executed if, and only if, [4mcommand1[24m returns an exit status of
       zero (success).

       An OR list has the form

              [4mcommand1[24m [1m|| [4m[22mcommand2[0m

       [4mcommand2[24m is executed if, and only if, [4mcommand1[24m returns a  non-zero  exit
       status.  The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the
       last command executed in the list.

   [1mCompound Commands[0m
       A  [4mcompound[24m  [4mcommand[24m is one of the following.  In most cases a [4mlist[24m in a
       command's description may be separated from the rest of the  command  by
       one  or  more  newlines,  and may be followed by a newline in place of a
       semicolon.

       ([4mlist[24m) [4mlist[24m is executed in a subshell (see [1mCOMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT[0m
              below for a description of a subshell environment).  Variable as‐
              signments and builtin commands that affect the  shell's  environ‐
              ment  do  not  remain in effect after the command completes.  The
              return status is the exit status of [4mlist[24m.

       { [4mlist[24m; }
              [4mlist[24m is executed in the current shell environment.  [4mlist[24m must  be
              terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is known as a [4mgroup[0m
              [4mcommand[24m.  The return status is the exit status of [4mlist[24m.

              Note that unlike the metacharacters [1m( [22mand [1m)[22m, [1m{ [22mand [1m} [22mare [4mreserved[0m
              [4mwords[24m  and  must  occur  where a reserved word is permitted to be
              recognized.  Since they do not cause a word break, they  must  be
              separated from [4mlist[24m by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.

       (([4mexpression[24m))
              The arithmetic [4mexpression[24m is evaluated according to the rules de‐
              scribed  below  under [1mARITHMETIC EVALUATION[22m.  If the value of the
              expression is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the re‐
              turn status is 1.  The [4mexpression[24m undergoes the  same  expansions
              as  if  it  were within double quotes, but unescaped double quote
              characters in [4mexpression[24m are not treated specially  and  are  re‐
              moved.   Since this can potentially result in empty strings, this
              command treats those as expressions that evaluate to 0.

       [1m[[ [4m[22mexpression[24m [1m]][0m
              Evaluate the conditional expression [4mexpression[24m and return a  sta‐
              tus of zero (true) or non-zero (false).  Expressions are composed
              of  the  primaries described below under [1mCONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS[22m.
              The words between the [1m[[ [22mand [1m]] [22mdo not undergo word splitting and
              pathname expansion.  The shell performs tilde expansion,  parame‐
              ter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substi‐
              tution,  process  substitution, and quote removal on those words.
              Conditional operators such as [1m-f [22mmust be unquoted  to  be  recog‐
              nized as primaries.

              When  used  with [1m[[[22m, the [1m< [22mand [1m> [22moperators sort lexicographically
              using the current locale.

              When the [1m== [22mand [1m!= [22moperators are used, the string to the right of
              the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to the
              rules described below under [1mPattern Matching[22m, as if  the  [1mextglob[0m
              shell  option  were enabled.  The [1m= [22moperator is equivalent to [1m==[22m.
              If the [1mnocasematch [22mshell option is enabled,  the  match  is  per‐
              formed  without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  The
              return value is 0 if the string matches ([1m==[22m) or  does  not  match
              ([1m!=[22m) the pattern, and 1 otherwise.  If any part of the pattern is
              quoted,  the quoted portion is matched as a string: every charac‐
              ter in the quoted portion matches itself, instead of  having  any
              special pattern matching meaning.

              An  additional  binary  operator, [1m=~[22m, is available, with the same
              precedence as [1m== [22mand [1m!=[22m.  When it is  used,  the  string  to  the
              right  of the operator is considered a POSIX extended regular ex‐
              pression and matched accordingly (using  the  POSIX  [4mregcomp[24m  and
              [4mregexec[24m  interfaces  usually  described in [4mregex[24m(3)).  The return
              value is 0 if the string matches the pattern,  and  1  otherwise.
              If  the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the condi‐
              tional expression's return value is 2.  If the [1mnocasematch  [22mshell
              option  is  enabled, the match is performed without regard to the
              case of alphabetic characters.

              If any part of the pattern  is  quoted,  the  quoted  portion  is
              matched literally, as above.  If the pattern is stored in a shell
              variable,  quoting  the variable expansion forces the entire pat‐
              tern to be matched literally.  Treat bracket expressions in regu‐
              lar expressions carefully, since normal quoting and pattern char‐
              acters lose their meanings between brackets.

              The match succeeds if the pattern matches any part of the string.
              Anchor the pattern using the [1m^ [22mand [1m$ [22mregular expression operators
              to force it to match the entire string.

              The array variable [1mBASH_REMATCH [22mrecords which parts of the string
              matched the pattern.  The element of [1mBASH_REMATCH  [22mwith  index  0
              contains  the  portion  of the string matching the entire regular
              expression.  Substrings matched by  parenthesized  subexpressions
              within the regular expression are saved in the remaining [1mBASH_RE‐[0m
              [1mMATCH  [22mindices.   The element of [1mBASH_REMATCH [22mwith index [4mn[24m is the
              portion of the string matching the [4mn[24mth  parenthesized  subexpres‐
              sion.   [1mBash  [22msets [1mBASH_REMATCH [22min the global scope; declaring it
              as a local variable will lead to unexpected results.

              Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed
              in decreasing order of precedence:

              [1m( [4m[22mexpression[24m [1m)[0m
                     Returns the value of [4mexpression[24m.   This  may  be  used  to
                     override the normal precedence of operators.
              [1m! [4m[22mexpression[0m
                     True if [4mexpression[24m is false.
              [4mexpression1[24m [1m&& [4m[22mexpression2[0m
                     True if both [4mexpression1[24m and [4mexpression2[24m are true.
              [4mexpression1[24m [1m|| [4m[22mexpression2[0m
                     True if either [4mexpression1[24m or [4mexpression2[24m is true.

              The  [1m&& [22mand [1m|| [22moperators do not evaluate [4mexpression2[24m if the value
              of [4mexpression1[24m is sufficient to determine the return value of the
              entire conditional expression.

              First, expand The list of words following [1min[22m, generating  a  list
              of items.  Then, the variable [4mname[24m is set to each element of this
              list  in turn, and [4mlist[24m is executed each time.  If the [1min [4m[22mword[24m is
              omitted, the [1mfor [22mcommand executes [4mlist[24m once for  each  positional
              parameter  that is set (see [1mPARAMETERS [22mbelow).  The return status
              is the exit status of the last command that executes.  If the ex‐
              pansion of the items following [1min [22mresults in an  empty  list,  no
              commands are executed, and the return status is 0.

              First,  evaluate the arithmetic expression [4mexpr1[24m according to the
              rules described below under [1mARITHMETIC EVALUATION[22m.  Then, repeat‐
              edly evaluate the arithmetic expression [4mexpr2[24m until it  evaluates
              to  zero.  Each time [4mexpr2[24m evaluates to a non-zero value, execute
              [4mlist[24m and evaluate the arithmetic expression [4mexpr3[24m.   If  any  ex‐
              pression is omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1.  The re‐
              turn value is the exit status of the last command in [4mlist[24m that is
              executed, or non-zero if any of the expressions is invalid.

              Use  the  [1mbreak [22mand [1mcontinue [22mbuiltins (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS[0m

              First, expand the list of words following [1min[22m, generating  a  list
              of items, and print the set of expanded words the standard error,
              each  preceded by a number.  If the [1min [4m[22mword[24m is omitted, print the

              A [1mcase [22mcommand first expands [4mword[24m, and tries to match it  against
              each  [4mpattern[24m  in  turn, proceeding from first to last, using the
              matching rules described under [1mPattern Matching [22mbelow.  A pattern
              list is a set of one or more patterns separated by ,  and  the  )
              operator terminates the pattern list.  The [4mword[24m is expanded using
              tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic ex‐
              pansion, command substitution, process substitution and quote re‐
              moval.   Each [4mpattern[24m examined is expanded using tilde expansion,
              parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic  expansion,  command
              substitution,  process  substitution,  and quote removal.  If the
              [1mnocasematch [22mshell option is enabled, the match is performed with‐
              out regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  A [4mclause[24m  is  a
              pattern list and an associated [4mlist[24m.

              When  a match is found, [1mcase [22mexecutes the corresponding [4mlist[24m.  If
              the [1m;; [22moperator terminates the case clause, the [1mcase [22mcommand com‐
              pletes after the first match.  Using [1m;& [22min place of [1m;; [22mcauses ex‐

              tern list.  Using [1m;;& [22min place of [1m;; [22mcauses the shell to test the
              next pattern list in the statement, if any, and execute any asso‐
              ciated  [4mlist[24m if the match succeeds, continuing the case statement
              execution as if the pattern list had not matched.  The exit  sta‐
              tus is zero if no pattern matches.

              Otherwise,  it is the exit status of the last command executed in

              zero.  The [1muntil [22mcommand is identical to the [1mwhile  [22mcommand,  ex‐
              cept  that the test is negated: [4mlist-2[24m is executed as long as the
              last command in [4mlist-1[24m returns a non-zero exit status.  The  exit
              status  of the [1mwhile [22mand [1muntil [22mcommands is the exit status of the
              last command executed in [4mlist-2[24m, or zero if none was executed.

   [1mCoprocesses[0m
       A [4mcoprocess[24m is a shell command preceded by the [1mcoproc [22mreserved word.   A
       coprocess  is  executed  asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command
       had been terminated with the [1m& [22mcontrol operator, with a two-way pipe es‐
       tablished between the executing shell and the coprocess.

       The syntax for a coprocess is:

              [1mcoproc [22m[[4mNAME[24m] [4mcommand[24m [[4mredirections[24m]

       This creates a coprocess named [4mNAME[24m.  [4mcommand[24m may  be  either  a  simple
       command  or  a  compound  command (see above).  [4mNAME[24m is a shell variable
       name.  If [4mNAME[24m is not supplied, the default name is [1mCOPROC[22m.

       The recommended form to use for a coprocess is

              [1mcoproc [4m[22mNAME[24m { [4mcommand[24m [[4mredirections[24m]; }

       This form is preferred because simple commands result in  the  coprocess
       always  being  named  [1mCOPROC[22m, and it is simpler to use and more complete
       than the other compound commands.

       If [4mcommand[24m is a compound command, [4mNAME[24m is optional. The  word  following
       [1mcoproc  [22mdetermines  whether that word is interpreted as a variable name:
       it is interpreted as [4mNAME[24m if it is not a reserved word that introduces a
       compound command.  If [4mcommand[24m is a simple command, [4mNAME[24m is not  allowed;
       this is to avoid confusion between [4mNAME[24m and the first word of the simple
       command.

       When the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array variable (see
       [1mArrays  [22mbelow)  named  [4mNAME[24m  in the context of the executing shell.  The
       standard output of [4mcommand[24m is connected via a pipe to a file  descriptor
       in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to [4mNAME[24m[0].
       The standard input of [4mcommand[24m is connected via a pipe to a file descrip‐
       tor  in  the  executing  shell,  and that file descriptor is assigned to
       [4mNAME[24m[1].  This pipe is established before any redirections specified  by
       the  command  (see [1mREDIRECTION [22mbelow).  The file descriptors can be uti‐
       lized as arguments to shell commands  and  redirections  using  standard
       word  expansions.   Other  than  those  created  to  execute command and
       process substitutions, the file descriptors are not  available  in  sub‐
       shells.

       The  process  ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is avail‐
       able as the value of the variable [4mNAME[24m_PID.  The  [1mwait  [22mbuiltin  may  be
       used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.

       Since  the  coprocess  is created as an asynchronous command, the [1mcoproc[0m
       command always returns success.  The return status of a coprocess is the
       exit status of [4mcommand[24m.

   [1mShell Function Definitions[0m
       A shell function is an object that is called like a simple  command  and
       executes  a  compound  command  with a new set of positional parameters.
       Shell functions are declared as follows:

       [4mfname[24m () [4mcompound-command[24m [[4mredirection[24m]
       [1mfunction [4m[22mfname[24m [()] [4mcompound-command[24m [[4mredirection[24m]
              This defines a function named [4mfname[24m.  The reserved word  [1mfunction[0m
              is  optional.   If  the  [1mfunction  [22mreserved word is supplied, the
              parentheses are optional.  The [4mbody[24m of the function is  the  com‐
              pound  command  [4mcompound-command[24m  (see  [1mCompound Commands [22mabove).
              That command is usually a [4mlist[24m of commands between { and  },  but
              may  be any command listed under [1mCompound Commands [22mabove.  If the
              [1mfunction [22mreserved word is used, but the parentheses are not  sup‐
              plied,  the braces are recommended.  [4mcompound-command[24m is executed
              whenever [4mfname[24m is specified as the  name  of  a  simple  command.
              When  in posix mode, [4mfname[24m must be a valid shell [4mname[24m and may not
              be the name of one of the POSIX  [4mspecial[24m  [4mbuiltins[24m.   In  default
              mode,  a  function  name can be any unquoted shell word that does
              not contain [1m$[22m.

       Any redirections (see [1mREDIRECTION [22mbelow) specified when  a  function  is
       defined are performed when the function is executed.

       The  exit  status of a function definition is zero unless a syntax error
       occurs or a readonly function with the same name already  exists.   When
       executed,  the  exit status of a function is the exit status of the last
       command executed in the body.  (See [1mFUNCTIONS [22mbelow.)

[1mCOMMENTS[0m
       In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the  [1minter‐[0m
       [1mactive_comments  [22moption  to  the  [1mshopt  [22mbuiltin  is  enabled (see [1mSHELL[0m
       [1mBUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow), a word beginning with [1m# [22mintroduces  a  comment.
       A  word begins at the beginning of a line, after unquoted whitespace, or
       after an operator.  The comment causes that word and all remaining char‐
       acters on that line to be ignored.  An interactive shell without the [1min‐[0m
       [1mteractive_comments [22moption enabled does not allow comments.  The [1minterac‐[0m
       [1mtive_comments [22moption is enabled by default in interactive shells.

[1mQUOTING[0m
       [4mQuoting[24m is used to remove the special meaning of certain  characters  or
       words  to  the  shell.  Quoting can be used to disable special treatment
       for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being  recognized
       as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.

       Each  of  the  [4mmetacharacters[24m listed above under [1mDEFINITIONS [22mhas special
       meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.

       When the command history expansion facilities are being used  (see  [1mHIS‐[0m
       [1mTORY  EXPANSION [22mbelow), the [4mhistory[24m [4mexpansion[24m character, usually [1m![22m, must
       be quoted to prevent history expansion.

       There are four quoting mechanisms: the [4mescape[24m [4mcharacter[24m, single  quotes,
       double quotes, and dollar-single quotes.

       A  non-quoted  backslash  ([1m\[22m) is the [4mescape[24m [4mcharacter[24m.  It preserves the
       literal value of the next character that follows, removing  any  special
       meaning  it  has, with the exception of <newline>.  If a [1m\[22m<newline> pair
       appears, and the backslash is  not  itself  quoted,  the  [1m\[22m<newline>  is
       treated  as  a  line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input
       stream and effectively ignored).

       Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves  the  literal  value  of
       each  character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between
       single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.

       Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all
       characters within the quotes, with the exception of [1m$[22m, [1m`[22m, [1m\[22m,  and,  when
       history expansion is enabled, [1m![22m.  When the shell is in posix mode, the [1m![0m
       has no special meaning within double quotes, even when history expansion
       is  enabled.  The characters [1m$ [22mand [1m` [22mretain their special meaning within
       double quotes.  The backslash retains its special meaning only when fol‐
       lowed by one of the following characters: [1m$[22m,  [1m`[22m,  [1m"[22m,  [1m\[22m,  or  [1m<newline>[22m.
       Backslashes  preceding characters without a special meaning are left un‐
       modified.

       A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a
       backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an  [1m![0m
       appearing  in double quotes is escaped using a backslash.  The backslash
       preceding the [1m!  [22mis not removed.

       The special parameters [1m* [22mand [1m@  [22mhave  special  meaning  when  in  double
       quotes (see [1mPARAMETERS [22mbelow).

       Character sequences of the form [1m$[22m'[4mstring[24m' are treated as a special vari‐
       ant  of  single quotes.  The sequence expands to [4mstring[24m, with backslash-
       escaped characters in [4mstring[24m replaced as specified by the ANSI  C  stan‐
       dard.  Backslash escape sequences, if present, are decoded as follows:
              [1m\a     [22malert (bell)
              [1m\b     [22mbackspace
              [1m\e[0m
              [1m\E     [22man escape character

              [1m\?     [22mquestion mark
              [1m\[4m[22mnnn[24m   The eight-bit character whose value is the octal value [4mnnn[0m
                     (one to three octal digits).
              [1m\x[4m[22mHH[24m   The  eight-bit  character  whose  value is the hexadecimal
                     value [4mHH[24m (one or two hex digits).
              [1m\u[4m[22mHHHH[24m The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value  is  the
                     hexadecimal value [4mHHHH[24m (one to four hex digits).
              [1m\U[4m[22mHHHHHHHH[0m
                     The  Unicode  (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the
                     hexadecimal value [4mHHHHHHHH[24m (one to eight hex digits).
              [1m\c[4m[22mx[24m    A control-[4mx[24m character.

       The expanded result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had not been
       present.

   [1mTranslating Strings[0m
       A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign ([1m$[22m"[4mstring[24m") causes  the
       string  to  be  translated according to the current locale.  The [4mgettext[0m
       infrastructure performs the lookup and translation,  using  the  [1mLC_MES‐[0m
       [1mSAGES[22m,  [1mTEXTDOMAINDIR[22m,  and  [1mTEXTDOMAIN [22mshell variables.  If the current
       locale is [1mC [22mor [1mPOSIX[22m, if there are no translations available, or if  the
       string  is not translated, the dollar sign is ignored, and the string is
       treated as double-quoted as described above.  This is a form  of  double
       quoting,  so the string remains double-quoted by default, whether or not
       it is translated and replaced.  If the  [1mnoexpand_translation  [22moption  is
       enabled  using  the  [1mshopt [22mbuiltin, translated strings are single-quoted
       instead of double-quoted.  See the  description  of  [1mshopt  [22mbelow  under
       [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS[22m.

[1mPARAMETERS[0m
       A  [4mparameter[24m  is an entity that stores values.  It can be a [4mname[24m, a num‐
       ber, or one of the special characters listed below under [1mSpecial Parame‐[0m
       [1mters[22m.  A [4mvariable[24m is a parameter denoted by a [4mname[24m.  A  variable  has  a
       [4mvalue[24m  and  zero  or more [4mattributes[24m.  Attributes are assigned using the
       [1mdeclare [22mbuiltin command (see [1mdeclare [22mbelow in [1mSHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS[22m).
       The [1mexport [22mand [1mreadonly [22mbuiltins assign specific attributes.

       A  parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is
       a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset  only  by  using
       the [1munset [22mbuiltin command (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).

       A [4mvariable[24m is assigned to using a statement of the form

              [4mname[24m=[[4mvalue[24m]

       If  [4mvalue[24m  is  not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All
       [4mvalues[24m undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable  expansion,  com‐
       mand  substitution,  arithmetic expansion, and quote removal (see [1mEXPAN‐[0m
       [1mSION [22mbelow).  If the variable has its [1minteger [22mattribute set, then  [4mvalue[0m
       is  evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the [1m$(([22m...[1m)) [22mexpansion
       is not used (see [1mArithmetic Expansion [22mbelow).  Word splitting and  path‐
       name expansion are not performed.  Assignment statements may also appear
       as arguments to the [1malias[22m, [1mdeclare[22m, [1mtypeset[22m, [1mexport[22m, [1mreadonly[22m, and [1mlocal[0m
       builtin  commands  ([4mdeclaration[24m  commands).   When  in posix mode, these
       builtins may appear in a command after one or more instances of the [1mcom‐[0m
       [1mmand [22mbuiltin and retain these assignment statement properties.

       In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value  to  a
       shell  variable  or array index, the “+=” operator appends to or adds to
       the variable's previous value.  This includes arguments  to  [4mdeclaration[0m
       commands  such  as [1mdeclare [22mthat accept assignment statements.  When “+=”
       is applied to a variable for which the [1minteger [22mattribute has  been  set,
       the  variable's current value and [4mvalue[24m are each evaluated as arithmetic
       expressions, and the sum of the results is assigned  as  the  variable's
       value.   The current value is usually an integer constant, but may be an
       expression.  When “+=” is applied to an array  variable  using  compound
       assignment  (see [1mArrays [22mbelow), the variable's value is not unset (as it
       is when using “=”), and new values are appended to the  array  beginning
       at  one  greater  than the array's maximum index (for indexed arrays) or
       added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array.   When  ap‐
       plied to a string-valued variable, [4mvalue[24m is expanded and appended to the
       variable's value.

       A  variable can be assigned the [4mnameref[24m attribute using the [1m-n [22moption to
       the [1mdeclare [22mor [1mlocal [22mbuiltin commands (see the descriptions  of  [1mdeclare[0m
       and  [1mlocal  [22mbelow)  to create a [4mnameref[24m, or a reference to another vari‐
       able.  This allows variables to be manipulated indirectly.  Whenever the
       nameref variable is referenced, assigned to, unset, or has  its  attrib‐
       utes  modified  (other  than using or changing the [4mnameref[24m attribute it‐
       self), the operation is actually performed on the variable specified  by
       the  nameref  variable's value.  A nameref is commonly used within shell
       functions to refer to a variable whose name is passed as an argument  to
       the  function.   For  instance,  if a variable name is passed to a shell
       function as its first argument, running

              declare -n ref=$1

       inside the function creates a local nameref variable [1mref [22mwhose value  is
       the  variable name passed as the first argument.  References and assign‐
       ments to [1mref[22m, and changes to its attributes, are treated as  references,
       assignments,  and attribute modifications to the variable whose name was
       passed as [1m$1[22m.  If the control variable in a [1mfor [22mloop has the nameref at‐
       tribute, the list of words can be a list of shell variables, and a  name
       reference  is  established  for each word in the list, in turn, when the
       loop is executed.  Array variables  cannot  be  given  the  [1mnameref  [22mat‐
       tribute.   However,  nameref variables can reference array variables and
       subscripted array variables.  Namerefs can be unset using the [1m-n  [22moption
       to  the [1munset [22mbuiltin.  Otherwise, if [1munset [22mis executed with the name of
       a nameref variable as  an  argument,  the  variable  referenced  by  the
       nameref variable is unset.

       When  the  shell  starts,  it  reads its environment and creates a shell
       variable from each environment variable that has a valid  name,  as  de‐
       scribed below (see [1mENVIRONMENT[22m).

   [1mPositional Parameters[0m
       A  [4mpositional[24m  [4mparameter[24m  is  a parameter denoted by one or more digits,
       other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are assigned  from
       the  shell's  arguments  when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using
       the [1mset [22mbuiltin command.  Positional parameters may not be  assigned  to
       with  assignment  statements.  The positional parameters are temporarily
       replaced when a shell function is executed (see [1mFUNCTIONS [22mbelow).

       When a positional parameter consisting of more than a  single  digit  is
       expanded,  it must be enclosed in braces (see [1mEXPANSION [22mbelow).  Without
       braces, a digit following $ can only refer to one of the first nine  po‐
       sitional  parameters  ([1m$1-$9[22m)  or the special parameter [1m$0 [22m(see the next
       section).

   [1mSpecial Parameters[0m
       The shell treats several parameters  specially.   These  parameters  may
       only  be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.  Special parame‐
       ters are denoted by one of the following characters.

       [1m*      [22m([1m$*[22m) Expands to the positional  parameters,  starting  from  one.
              When  the  expansion is not within double quotes, each positional
              parameter expands to a separate word.  In contexts where word ex‐
              pansions are performed, those words are subject to  further  word
              splitting  and  pathname  expansion.   When  the expansion occurs
              within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the  value
              of  each  parameter  separated  by the first character of the [1mIFS[0m
              variable.  That is, [1m"$*" [22mis equivalent to [1m"$1[4m[22mc[24m[1m$2[4m[22mc[24m[1m..."[22m, where [4mc[24m is
              the first character of the value of the [1mIFS [22mvariable.  If [1mIFS  [22mis
              unset,  the  parameters are separated by spaces.  If [1mIFS [22mis null,
              the parameters are joined without intervening separators.
       [1m@      [22m([1m$@[22m) Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  In
              contexts where word splitting is performed, this expands each po‐
              sitional parameter to a  separate  word;  if  not  within  double
              quotes,  these  words are subject to word splitting.  In contexts
              where word splitting is not performed, such as the value  portion
              of  an  assignment  statement, this expands to a single word with
              each positional parameter separated by a space.  When the  expan‐
              sion  occurs  within  double  quotes,  and word splitting is per‐
              formed, each parameter expands to a separate word.  That is, [1m"$@"[0m
              is equivalent to [1m"$1" "$2" ...  [22mIf  the  double-quoted  expansion
              occurs  within  a  word,  the expansion of the first parameter is
              joined with the expansion of the beginning part of  the  original
              word,  and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the
              expansion of the last part of the original word.  When there  are
              no  positional  parameters,  [1m"$@" [22mand [1m$@ [22mexpand to nothing (i.e.,
              they are removed).
       [1m#      [22m([1m$#[22m) Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
       [1m?      [22m([1m$?[22m) Expands to the exit status of  the  most  recently  executed
              command.
       [1m-      [22m([1m$-[22m)  Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invo‐
              cation, by the [1mset [22mbuiltin command, or those set by the shell it‐
              self (such as the [1m-i [22moption).
       [1m$      [22m([1m$$[22m) Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a  subshell,  it
              expands to the process ID of the parent shell, not the subshell.
       [1m!      [22m([1m$![22m)Expands  to  the  process  ID of the job most recently placed
              into the background, whether executed as an asynchronous  command
              or using the [1mbg [22mbuiltin (see [1mJOB CONTROL [22mbelow).
       [1m0      [22m([1m$0[22m)  Expands  to the name of the shell or shell script.  This is
              set at shell initialization.  If [1mbash [22mis invoked with a  file  of
              commands, [1m$0 [22mis set to the name of that file.  If [1mbash [22mis started
              with  the  [1m-c  [22moption, then [1m$0 [22mis set to the first argument after
              the string to be executed, if one is present.  Otherwise,  it  is
              set  to  the  filename  used to invoke [1mbash[22m, as given by argument
              zero.

   [1mShell Variables[0m
       The shell sets following variables:

       [1m_      [22m([1m$_[22m, an underscore) This has a number of  meanings  depending  on
              context.   At shell startup, [1m_ [22mis set to the pathname used to in‐
              voke the shell or shell script being executed as  passed  in  the
              environment  or  argument  list.  Subsequently, it expands to the
              last argument to the previous  simple  command  executed  in  the
              foreground, after expansion.  It is also set to the full pathname
              used  to  invoke each command executed and placed in the environ‐
              ment exported to that command.  When checking mail, [1m$_ [22mexpands to
              the name of the mail file currently being checked.
       [1mBASH   [22mExpands to the full filename used  to  invoke  this  instance  of
              [1mbash[22m.
       [1mBASHOPTS[0m
              A  colon-separated  list  of enabled shell options.  Each word in
              the list is a valid argument for  the  [1m-s  [22moption  to  the  [1mshopt[0m
              builtin  command (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).  The options
              appearing in [1mBASHOPTS [22mare those reported as [4mon[24m by [1mshopt[22m.  If this
              variable is in the environment when [1mbash [22mstarts up, the shell en‐
              ables each option in the list before reading any  startup  files.
              If  this  variable is exported, child shells will enable each op‐
              tion in the list.  This variable is read-only.
       [1mBASHPID[0m
              Expands to the process ID of the current [1mbash [22mprocess.  This dif‐
              fers from [1m$$ [22munder certain circumstances, such as subshells  that
              do not require [1mbash [22mto be re-initialized.  Assignments to [1mBASHPID[0m
              have  no effect.  If [1mBASHPID [22mis unset, it loses its special prop‐
              erties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mBASH_ALIASES[0m
              An associative array variable whose members correspond to the in‐
              ternal list of aliases as maintained by the [1malias [22mbuiltin.   Ele‐
              ments  added to this array appear in the alias list; however, un‐
              setting array elements currently does not remove aliases from the
              alias list.  If [1mBASH_ALIASES [22mis unset, it loses its special prop‐
              erties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mBASH_ARGC[0m
              An array variable whose values are the number  of  parameters  in
              each  frame of the current [1mbash [22mexecution call stack.  The number
              of parameters to the current subroutine (shell function or script
              executed with [1m. [22mor [1msource[22m) is at the top of the  stack.   When  a
              subroutine is executed, the number of parameters passed is pushed
              onto  [1mBASH_ARGC[22m.   The shell sets [1mBASH_ARGC [22monly when in extended
              debugging mode (see the description of the [1mextdebug [22moption to the
              [1mshopt [22mbuiltin below).   Setting  [1mextdebug  [22mafter  the  shell  has
              started  to  execute  a script, or referencing this variable when
              [1mextdebug [22mis not set, may result in inconsistent values.   Assign‐
              ments to [1mBASH_ARGC [22mhave no effect, and it may not be unset.
       [1mBASH_ARGV[0m
              An array variable containing all of the parameters in the current
              [1mbash  [22mexecution call stack.  The final parameter of the last sub‐
              routine call is at the top of the stack; the first  parameter  of
              the  initial  call  is  at the bottom.  When a subroutine is exe‐
              cuted, the shell pushes the supplied parameters  onto  [1mBASH_ARGV[22m.
              The  shell  sets  [1mBASH_ARGV  [22monly when in extended debugging mode
              (see the description of the [1mextdebug [22moption to the [1mshopt  [22mbuiltin
              below).   Setting [1mextdebug [22mafter the shell has started to execute
              a script, or referencing this variable when [1mextdebug [22mis not  set,
              may result in inconsistent values.  Assignments to [1mBASH_ARGV [22mhave
              no effect, and it may not be unset.
       [1mBASH_ARGV0[0m
              When  referenced,  this variable expands to the name of the shell
              or shell script (identical to [1m$0[22m; see the description of  special
              parameter  0  above).  Assigning a value to [1mBASH_ARGV0 [22msets [1m$0 [22mto
              the same value.  If [1mBASH_ARGV0 [22mis unset,  it  loses  its  special
              properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mBASH_CMDS[0m
              An associative array variable whose members correspond to the in‐
              ternal  hash table of commands as maintained by the [1mhash [22mbuiltin.
              Adding elements to this array makes them appear in the  hash  ta‐
              ble;  however, unsetting array elements currently does not remove
              command names from the hash table.  If  [1mBASH_CMDS  [22mis  unset,  it
              loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mBASH_COMMAND[0m
              Expands  to  the  command currently being executed or about to be
              executed, unless the shell is executing a command as  the  result
              of  a trap, in which case it is the command executing at the time
              of the trap.  If [1mBASH_COMMAND [22mis  unset,  it  loses  its  special
              properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mBASH_EXECUTION_STRING[0m
              The command argument to the [1m-c [22minvocation option.
       [1mBASH_LINENO[0m
              An  array  variable  whose members are the line numbers in source
              files where each corresponding member of  [1mFUNCNAME  [22mwas  invoked.
              [1m${BASH_LINENO[[4m[22m$i[24m[1m]}   [22mis  the  line  number  in  the  source  file
              ([1m${BASH_SOURCE[[4m[22m$i+1[24m[1m]}[22m)  where  [1m${FUNCNAME[[4m[22m$i[24m[1m]}  [22mwas  called   (or
              [1m${BASH_LINENO[[4m[22m$i-1[24m[1m]}  [22mif  referenced  within  another shell func‐
              tion).  Use [1mLINENO [22mto obtain the current  line  number.   Assign‐
              ments to [1mBASH_LINENO [22mhave no effect, and it may not be unset.
       [1mBASH_LOADABLES_PATH[0m
              A colon-separated list of directories in which the [1menable [22mcommand
              looks for dynamically loadable builtins.
       [1mBASH_MONOSECONDS[0m
              Each  time  this  variable is referenced, it expands to the value
              returned by the system's monotonic clock, if  one  is  available.
              If  there  is no monotonic clock, this is equivalent to [1mEPOCHSEC‐[0m
              [1mONDS[22m.  If [1mBASH_MONOSECONDS [22mis unset, it loses its special proper‐
              ties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mBASH_REMATCH[0m
              An array variable whose members are assigned by the [1m=~ [22mbinary op‐
              erator to the [1m[[ [22mconditional command.  The element with  index  0
              is  the portion of the string matching the entire regular expres‐
              sion.  The element with index [4mn[24m is  the  portion  of  the  string
              matching the [4mn[24mth parenthesized subexpression.
       [1mBASH_SOURCE[0m
              An  array  variable  whose members are the source filenames where
              the corresponding shell function  names  in  the  [1mFUNCNAME  [22marray
              variable  are defined.  The shell function [1m${FUNCNAME[[4m[22m$i[24m[1m]} [22mis de‐
              fined  in   the   file   [1m${BASH_SOURCE[[4m[22m$i[24m[1m]}   [22mand   called   from
              [1m${BASH_SOURCE[[4m[22m$i+1[24m[1m]}[22m.  Assignments to [1mBASH_SOURCE [22mhave no effect,
              and it may not be unset.
       [1mBASH_SUBSHELL[0m
              Incremented  by  one within each subshell or subshell environment
              when the shell begins executing in that environment.  The initial
              value is 0.  If [1mBASH_SUBSHELL [22mis  unset,  it  loses  its  special
              properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mBASH_TRAPSIG[0m
              Set  to  the signal number corresponding to the trap action being
              executed during its execution.  See the description of [1mtrap [22munder
              [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow for information about signal numbers
              and trap execution.
       [1mBASH_VERSINFO[0m
              A readonly array variable whose members hold version  information
              for this instance of [1mbash[22m.  The values assigned to the array mem‐
              bers are as follows:
              [1mBASH_VERSINFO[[22m0[1m]        [22mThe major version number (the [4mrelease[24m).
              [1mBASH_VERSINFO[[22m1[1m]        [22mThe minor version number (the [4mversion[24m).
              [1mBASH_VERSINFO[[22m2[1m]        [22mThe patch level.
              [1mBASH_VERSINFO[[22m3[1m]        [22mThe build version.
              [1mBASH_VERSINFO[[22m4[1m]        [22mThe release status (e.g., [4mbeta[24m).
              [1mBASH_VERSINFO[[22m5[1m]        [22mThe value of [1mMACHTYPE[22m.
       [1mBASH_VERSION[0m
              Expands  to  a  string describing the version of this instance of
              [1mbash [22m(e.g., 5.2.37(3)-release).
       [1mCOMP_CWORD[0m
              An index into [1m${COMP_WORDS} [22mof the word  containing  the  current
              cursor  position.  This variable is available only in shell func‐
              tions invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see [1mPro‐[0m
              [1mgrammable Completion [22mbelow).
       [1mCOMP_KEY[0m
              The key (or final key of a key sequence) used to invoke the  cur‐
              rent  completion  function.   This  variable is available only in
              shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable
              completion facilities (see [1mProgrammable Completion [22mbelow).
       [1mCOMP_LINE[0m
              The current command line.  This variable  is  available  only  in
              shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable
              completion facilities (see [1mProgrammable Completion [22mbelow).
       [1mCOMP_POINT[0m
              The  index  of the current cursor position relative to the begin‐
              ning of the current command.  If the current cursor  position  is
              at  the end of the current command, the value of this variable is
              equal to [1m${#COMP_LINE}[22m.  This variable is available only in shell
              functions and external commands invoked by the programmable  com‐
              pletion facilities (see [1mProgrammable Completion [22mbelow).
       [1mCOMP_TYPE[0m
              Set  to  an  integer value corresponding to the type of attempted
              completion that caused a completion function to be  called:  [4mTAB[24m,
              for  normal  completion, [4m?[24m, for listing completions after succes‐
              sive tabs, [4m![24m, for listing alternatives on  partial  word  comple‐
              tion, [4m@[24m, to list completions if the word is not unmodified, or [4m%[24m,
              for  menu  completion.   This variable is available only in shell
              functions and external commands invoked by the programmable  com‐
              pletion facilities (see [1mProgrammable Completion [22mbelow).
       [1mCOMP_WORDBREAKS[0m
              The  set  of  characters that the [1mreadline [22mlibrary treats as word
              separators when performing word completion.   If  [1mCOMP_WORDBREAKS[0m
              is  unset,  it loses its special properties, even if it is subse‐
              quently reset.
       [1mCOMP_WORDS[0m
              An array variable (see [1mArrays [22mbelow) consisting of the individual
              words in the current command line.  The line is split into  words
              as  [1mreadline  [22mwould  split it, using [1mCOMP_WORDBREAKS [22mas described
              above.  This variable is available only in  shell  functions  in‐
              voked by the programmable completion facilities (see [1mProgrammable[0m
              [1mCompletion [22mbelow).
       [1mCOPROC [22mAn array variable (see [1mArrays [22mbelow) created to hold the file de‐
              scriptors  for output from and input to an unnamed coprocess (see
              [1mCoprocesses [22mabove).
       [1mDIRSTACK[0m
              An array variable (see [1mArrays [22mbelow) containing the current  con‐
              tents of the directory stack.  Directories appear in the stack in
              the  order  they are displayed by the [1mdirs [22mbuiltin.  Assigning to
              members of this array variable may be used to modify  directories

       [1mFUNCNAME[0m
              An  array  variable  containing  the names of all shell functions
              currently in the execution call stack.  The element with index  0
              is  the name of any currently-executing shell function.  The bot‐
              tom-most element (the one with  the  highest  index)  is  “main”.
              This  variable  exists  only  when a shell function is executing.
              Assignments to [1mFUNCNAME [22mhave no effect.  If [1mFUNCNAME [22mis unset, it
              loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

              This variable can be used with [1mBASH_LINENO [22mand [1mBASH_SOURCE[22m.  Each

       [1mHISTCMD[0m
              The history number, or index in the history list, of the  current

       [1mHOSTNAME[0m
              Automatically set to the name of the current host.
       [1mHOSTTYPE[0m
              Automatically set to a string that uniquely describes the type of

              An array variable (see [1mArrays [22mbelow) containing a  list  of  exit
              status  values  from  the  commands in the most-recently-executed
              foreground pipeline, which may consist of only a  simple  command

       [1mPWD    [22mThe current working directory as set by the [1mcd [22mcommand.
       [1mRANDOM [22mEach time this parameter is referenced, it expands  to  a  random
              integer  between  0  and 32767.  Assigning a value to [1mRANDOM [22mini‐
              tializes (seeds) the sequence of  random  numbers.   Seeding  the
              random number generator with the same constant value produces the
              same  sequence  of values.  If [1mRANDOM [22mis unset, it loses its spe‐
              cial properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mREADLINE_ARGUMENT[0m
              Any numeric argument given to a [1mreadline [22mcommand that was defined
              using “bind -x” (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow)  when  it  was
              invoked.
       [1mREADLINE_LINE[0m
              The  contents of the [1mreadline [22mline buffer, for use with “bind -x”
              (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).
       [1mREADLINE_MARK[0m
              The position of the mark (saved insertion point) in the  [1mreadline[0m
              line  buffer,  for use with “bind -x” (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS[0m
              below).  The characters between the insertion point and the  mark
              are often called the [4mregion[24m.
       [1mREADLINE_POINT[0m
              The  position of the insertion point in the [1mreadline [22mline buffer,
              for use with “bind -x” (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).
       [1mREPLY  [22mSet to the line of input read by the [1mread [22mbuiltin command when no
              arguments are supplied.
       [1mSECONDS[0m
              Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the  number
              of  seconds  since  shell  invocation.  If a value is assigned to
              [1mSECONDS[22m, the value returned upon  subsequent  references  is  the
              number  of  seconds since the assignment plus the value assigned.
              The number of seconds at shell invocation and  the  current  time
              are  always determined by querying the system clock at one-second
              resolution.  If [1mSECONDS [22mis unset, it loses  its  special  proper‐
              ties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mSHELLOPTS[0m
              A  colon-separated  list  of enabled shell options.  Each word in
              the list is a valid argument for the [1m-o [22moption to the [1mset [22mbuiltin
              command (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).  The options  appear‐
              ing  in  [1mSHELLOPTS  [22mare  those reported as [4mon[24m by [1mset -o[22m.  If this
              variable is in the environment when [1mbash [22mstarts up, the shell en‐
              ables each option in the list before reading any  startup  files.
              If  this  variable is exported, child shells will enable each op‐
              tion in the list.  This variable is read-only.
       [1mSHLVL  [22mIncremented by one each time an instance of [1mbash [22mis started.
       [1mSRANDOM[0m
              Each time it is referenced, this variable  expands  to  a  32-bit
              pseudo-random  number.  The random number generator is not linear
              on systems that support [4m/dev/urandom[24m or  [4marc4random[24m(3),  so  each
              returned  number has no relationship to the numbers preceding it.
              The random number generator cannot be seeded, so  assignments  to
              this  variable have no effect.  If [1mSRANDOM [22mis unset, it loses its
              special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       [1mUID    [22mExpands to the user ID of the current user, initialized at  shell
              startup.  This variable is readonly.

       The  shell  uses  the following variables. In some cases, [1mbash [22massigns a
       default value to a variable; these cases are noted below.

       [1mBASH_COMPAT[0m
              The value is used to set the shell's  compatibility  level.   See
              [1mSHELL  COMPATIBILITY  MODE [22mbelow for a description of the various
              compatibility levels and their effects.  The value may be a deci‐
              mal number (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding  to
              the  desired compatibility level.  If [1mBASH_COMPAT [22mis unset or set
              to the empty string, the compatibility level is set  to  the  de‐
              fault  for the current version.  If [1mBASH_COMPAT [22mis set to a value
              that is not one of the  valid  compatibility  levels,  the  shell
              prints  an  error message and sets the compatibility level to the
              default for the current version.  A subset of  the  valid  values
              correspond  to  the  compatibility  levels  described below under
              [1mSHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE[22m.  For example, 4.2 and 42 are valid val‐
              ues that correspond to the [1mcompat42 shopt [22moption and set the com‐
              patibility level to 42.  The current  version  is  also  a  valid
              value.
       [1mBASH_ENV[0m
              If  this  parameter is set when [1mbash [22mis executing a shell script,
              its expanded value is interpreted as a filename  containing  com‐
              mands  to  initialize the shell before it reads and executes com‐
              mands from the script.  The value of [1mBASH_ENV [22mis subjected to pa‐
              rameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion
              before being interpreted as a filename.   [1mPATH  [22mis  not  used  to
              search for the resultant filename.
       [1mBASH_XTRACEFD[0m
              If  set  to  an integer corresponding to a valid file descriptor,
              [1mbash [22mwrites the trace output generated when “set -x”  is  enabled
              to that file descriptor, instead of the standard error.  The file
              descriptor  is  closed  when [1mBASH_XTRACEFD [22mis unset or assigned a
              new value.  Unsetting [1mBASH_XTRACEFD [22mor  assigning  it  the  empty
              string  causes the trace output to be sent to the standard error.
              Note that setting [1mBASH_XTRACEFD [22mto 2 (the standard error file de‐
              scriptor) and then unsetting it will result in the standard error
              being closed.
       [1mCDPATH [22mThe search path for the [1mcd [22mcommand.  This  is  a  colon-separated
              list  of directories where the shell looks for directories speci‐
              fied  as  arguments  to  the  [1mcd  [22mcommand.   A  sample  value  is
              “.:~:/usr”.
       [1mCHILD_MAX[0m
              Set the number of exited child status values for the shell to re‐
              member.   [1mBash  [22mwill not allow this value to be decreased below a
              POSIX-mandated minimum, and there is a maximum  value  (currently
              8192)  that this may not exceed.  The minimum value is system-de‐
              pendent.
       [1mCOLUMNS[0m
              Used by the [1mselect [22mcompound command  to  determine  the  terminal
              width  when  printing  selection lists.  Automatically set if the
              [1mcheckwinsize [22moption is enabled or in an  interactive  shell  upon
              receipt of a [1mSIGWINCH[22m.
       [1mCOMPREPLY[0m
              An  array variable from which [1mbash [22mreads the possible completions
              generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable comple‐
              tion facility (see [1mProgrammable Completion  [22mbelow).   Each  array
              element contains one possible completion.
       [1mEMACS  [22mIf  [1mbash  [22mfinds  this  variable in the environment when the shell
              starts with value “t”, it assumes that the shell is running in an
              Emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.
       [1mENV    [22mExpanded and  executed  similarly  to  [1mBASH_ENV  [22m(see  [1mINVOCATION[0m
              above) when an interactive shell is invoked in posix mode.
       [1mEXECIGNORE[0m
              A  colon-separated  list of shell patterns (see [1mPattern Matching[22m)
              defining the set of filenames to be ignored by command search us‐
              ing [1mPATH[22m.  Files whose full pathnames match one of these patterns
              are not considered executable files for the purposes  of  comple‐
              tion and command execution via [1mPATH [22mlookup.  This does not affect
              the  behavior of the [1m[[22m, [1mtest[22m, and [1m[[ [22mcommands.  Full pathnames in
              the command hash table are not subject to [1mEXECIGNORE[22m.   Use  this
              variable  to ignore shared library files that have the executable
              bit set, but are not executable files.  The pattern matching hon‐
              ors the setting of the [1mextglob [22mshell option.
       [1mFCEDIT [22mThe default editor for the [1mfc [22mbuiltin command.
       [1mFIGNORE[0m
              A colon-separated list of  suffixes  to  ignore  when  performing
              filename  completion (see [1mREADLINE [22mbelow).  A filename whose suf‐
              fix matches one of the entries in [1mFIGNORE [22mis  excluded  from  the
              list of matched filenames.  A sample value is “.o:~”.
       [1mFUNCNEST[0m
              If set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum func‐
              tion  nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed this nest‐
              ing level cause the current command to abort.
       [1mGLOBIGNORE[0m
              A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of file names
              to be ignored by pathname expansion.  If a file name matched by a
              pathname expansion pattern also matches one of  the  patterns  in
              [1mGLOBIGNORE[22m,  it is removed from the list of matches.  The pattern
              matching honors the setting of the [1mextglob [22mshell option.
       [1mGLOBSORT[0m
              Controls how the results of pathname expansion are  sorted.   The
              value of this variable specifies the sort criteria and sort order
              for the results of pathname expansion.  If this variable is unset
              or set to the null string, pathname expansion uses the historical
              behavior  of sorting by name, in ascending lexicographic order as
              determined by the [1mLC_COLLATE [22mshell variable.

              If set, a valid value begins with an optional  [4m+[24m,  which  is  ig‐
              nored,  or [4m-[24m, which reverses the sort order from ascending to de‐
              scending, followed by a sort specifier.  The  valid  sort  speci‐
              fiers  are  [4mname[24m, [4mnumeric[24m, [4msize[24m, [4mmtime[24m, [4matime[24m, [4mctime[24m, and [4mblocks[24m,
              which sort the files on name, names in numeric rather than  lexi‐
              cographic order, file size, modification time, access time, inode
              change  time,  and number of blocks, respectively.  If any of the
              non-name keys compare as equal (e.g., if two files are  the  same
              size), sorting uses the name as a secondary sort key.

              For  example,  a  value of [4m-mtime[24m sorts the results in descending
              order by modification time (newest first).

              The [4mnumeric[24m specifier treats names consisting solely of digits as
              numbers and sorts them using their numeric value  (so  “2”  sorts
              before  “10”, for example).  When using [4mnumeric[24m, names containing
              non-digits sort after all the all-digit names and are  sorted  by
              name using the traditional behavior.

              A  sort specifier of [4mnosort[24m disables sorting completely; [1mbash [22mre‐
              turns the results in the order they are read from the  file  sys‐
              tem, ignoring any leading [4m-[24m.

              If the sort specifier is missing, it defaults to [4mname[24m, so a value
              of  [4m+[24m is equivalent to the null string, and a value of [4m-[24m sorts by
              name in descending order.  Any invalid value restores the histor‐
              ical sorting behavior.
       [1mHISTCONTROL[0m
              A colon-separated list of values  controlling  how  commands  are
              saved  on  the  history  list.   If  the  list of values includes
              [4mignorespace[24m, lines which begin with a  [1mspace  [22mcharacter  are  not
              saved  in  the  history list.  A value of [4mignoredups[24m causes lines
              matching the previous history entry not to be saved.  A value  of
              [4mignoreboth[24m  is shorthand for [4mignorespace[24m and [4mignoredups[24m.  A value
              of [4merasedups[24m causes all previous lines matching the current  line
              to  be  removed  from the history list before that line is saved.
              Any value not in the above list is ignored.   If  [1mHISTCONTROL  [22mis
              unset,  or  does  not include a valid value, [1mbash [22msaves all lines
              read by the shell parser on the  history  list,  subject  to  the
              value  of [1mHISTIGNORE[22m.  If the first line of a multi-line compound
              command was saved,  the  second  and  subsequent  lines  are  not
              tested,  and  are added to the history regardless of the value of
              [1mHISTCONTROL[22m.  If the first line was not  saved,  the  second  and
              subsequent lines of the command are not saved either.
       [1mHISTFILE[0m
              The  name of the file in which command history is saved (see [1mHIS‐[0m
              [1mTORY [22mbelow).  [1mBash [22massigns a default  value  of  [4m~/.bash_history[24m.
              If [1mHISTFILE [22mis unset or null, the shell does not save the command
              history when it exits.
       [1mHISTFILESIZE[0m
              The  maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When
              this variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated,
              if necessary, to contain no more than the number of  history  en‐
              tries  that  total  no more than that number of lines by removing
              the oldest entries.  If the history list contains multi-line  en‐
              tries,  the history file may contain more lines than this maximum
              to avoid leaving partial history entries.  The  history  file  is
              also  truncated  to this size after writing it when a shell exits
              or by the [1mhistory [22mbuiltin.  If the value is 0, the  history  file
              is truncated to zero size.  Non-numeric values and numeric values
              less  than  zero  inhibit truncation.  The shell sets the default
              value to the value of [1mHISTSIZE [22mafter reading any startup files.
       [1mHISTIGNORE[0m
              A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide  which  command
              lines  should  be  saved  on the history list.  If a command line
              matches one of the patterns in the value of [1mHISTIGNORE[22m, it is not
              saved on the history list.  Each pattern is anchored at  the  be‐
              ginning  of  the line and must match the complete line ([1mbash [22mdoes
              not  implicitly append a “[1m*[22m”).  Each pattern  is  tested  against
              the  line  after the checks specified by [1mHISTCONTROL [22mare applied.
              In addition to the normal shell pattern matching characters,  “[1m&[22m”
              matches  the previous history line.  A backslash escapes the “[1m&[22m”;
              the backslash is removed before attempting a match.  If the first
              line of a multi-line compound command was saved, the  second  and
              subsequent lines are not tested, and are added to the history re‐
              gardless  of  the value of [1mHISTIGNORE[22m.  If the first line was not
              saved, the second and subsequent lines of  the  command  are  not
              saved  either.   The  pattern  matching honors the setting of the
              [1mextglob [22mshell option.
              [1mHISTIGNORE [22msubsumes some of the function of [1mHISTCONTROL[22m.  A  pat‐
              tern of “&” is identical to “ignoredups”, and a pattern of “[ ]*”
              is  identical  to  “ignorespace”.   Combining these two patterns,
              separating them with a colon, provides the  functionality  of  “‐
              ignoreboth”.
       [1mHISTSIZE[0m
              The  number  of  commands to remember in the command history (see
              [1mHISTORY [22mbelow).  If the value is 0, commands are not saved in the
              history list.  Numeric values less than zero result in every com‐
              mand being saved on the history list (there is  no  limit).   The
              shell  sets  the  default  value to 500 after reading any startup
              files.
       [1mHISTTIMEFORMAT[0m
              If this variable is set and not null, its value is used as a for‐
              mat string for [4mstrftime[24m(3) to print  the  time  stamp  associated
              with  each  history  entry  displayed by the [1mhistory [22mbuiltin.  If
              this variable is set, the shell writes time stamps to the history
              file so they may be preserved across shell sessions.   This  uses
              the  history  comment  character  to  distinguish timestamps from
              other history lines.
       [1mHOME   [22mThe home directory of the current user; the default argument  for
              the  [1mcd [22mbuiltin command.  The value of this variable is also used
              when performing tilde expansion.
       [1mHOSTFILE[0m
              Contains the name of a file in the same format as [4m/etc/hosts[24m that
              should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname.   The
              list  of  possible  hostname completions may be changed while the
              shell is running; the next time hostname completion is  attempted
              after  the  value  is  changed, [1mbash [22madds the contents of the new
              file to the existing list.  If [1mHOSTFILE [22mis set, but has no value,
              or  does  not  name  a  readable  file,  [1mbash  [22mattempts  to  read
              [4m/etc/hosts[24m  to  obtain the list of possible hostname completions.
              When [1mHOSTFILE [22mis unset, [1mbash [22mclears the hostname list.
       [1mIFS    [22mThe [4mInternal[24m [4mField[24m [4mSeparator[24m that is used for word splitting  af‐
              ter expansion and to split lines into words with the [1mread [22mbuiltin
              command.  Word splitting is described below under [1mEXPANSION[22m.  The
              default value is “<space><tab><newline>”.
       [1mIGNOREEOF[0m
              Controls  the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an [1mEOF[0m
              character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the number  of
              consecutive [1mEOF [22mcharacters which must be typed as the first char‐
              acters  on  an  input line before [1mbash [22mexits.  If the variable is
              set but does not have a numeric value, or the value is null,  the
              default  value  is  10.  If it is unset, [1mEOF [22msignifies the end of
              input to the shell.
       [1mINPUTRC[0m
              The filename for the [1mreadline [22mstartup file,  overriding  the  de‐
              fault of [4m~/.inputrc[24m (see [1mREADLINE [22mbelow).
       [1mINSIDE_EMACS[0m
              If  this  variable  appears  in  the  environment  when the shell
              starts, [1mbash [22massumes that it is running  inside  an  Emacs  shell
              buffer  and  may  disable line editing, depending on the value of
              [1mTERM[22m.
       [1mLANG   [22mUsed to determine  the  locale  category  for  any  category  not
              specifically selected with a variable starting with [1mLC_[22m.
       [1mLC_ALL [22mThis variable overrides the value of [1mLANG [22mand any other [1mLC_ [22mvari‐
              able specifying a locale category.
       [1mLC_COLLATE[0m
              This  variable  determines  the collation order used when sorting
              the results of pathname expansion, and determines the behavior of
              range expressions, equivalence classes, and  collating  sequences
              within pathname expansion and pattern matching.
       [1mLC_CTYPE[0m
              This variable determines the interpretation of characters and the
              behavior  of character classes within pathname expansion and pat‐
              tern matching.
       [1mLC_MESSAGES[0m
              This variable determines the locale  used  to  translate  double-
              quoted strings preceded by a [1m$[22m.
       [1mLC_NUMERIC[0m
              This variable determines the locale category used for number for‐
              matting.
       [1mLC_TIME[0m
              This  variable  determines  the locale category used for data and
              time formatting.
       [1mLINES  [22mUsed by the [1mselect  [22mcompound  command  to  determine  the  column
              length  for  printing  selection lists.  Automatically set if the
              [1mcheckwinsize [22moption is enabled or in an  interactive  shell  upon
              receipt of a [1mSIGWINCH[22m.
       [1mMAIL   [22mIf  the value is set to a file or directory name and the [1mMAILPATH[0m
              variable is not set, [1mbash [22minforms the user of the arrival of mail
              in the specified file or Maildir-format directory.
       [1mMAILCHECK[0m
              Specifies how often (in seconds) [1mbash [22mchecks for mail.   The  de‐
              fault  is  60  seconds.   When  it is time to check for mail, the
              shell does so before displaying  the  primary  prompt.   If  this
              variable is unset, or set to a value that is not a number greater
              than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking.
       [1mMAILPATH[0m
              A  colon-separated list of filenames to be checked for mail.  The
              message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular file  may
              be  specified  by separating the filename from the message with a
              “?”.  When used in the text of the message,  [1m$_  [22mexpands  to  the
              name of the current mailfile.  For example:
              [1mMAILPATH[22m='/var/mail/bfox?"You have mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has mail!"'
              [1mBash  [22mcan  be configured to supply a default value for this vari‐
              able (there is no value by default), but the location of the user
              mail  files   that   it   uses   is   system   dependent   (e.g.,
              /var/mail/[1m$USER[22m).
       [1mOPTERR [22mIf  set to the value 1, [1mbash [22mdisplays error messages generated by
              the [1mgetopts [22mbuiltin command (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN  COMMANDS  [22mbelow).
              [1mOPTERR  [22mis  initialized  to 1 each time the shell is invoked or a
              shell script is executed.
       [1mPATH   [22mThe search path for commands.  It is a  colon-separated  list  of
              directories  in  which  the shell looks for commands (see [1mCOMMAND[0m
              [1mEXECUTION [22mbelow).  A zero-length (null)  directory  name  in  the
              value  of [1mPATH [22mindicates the current directory.  A null directory
              name may appear as two adjacent  colons,  or  as  an  initial  or
              trailing colon.  The default path is system-dependent, and is set
              by the administrator who installs [1mbash[22m.  A common value is
                   /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
       [1mPOSIXLY_CORRECT[0m
              If  this  variable  is  in  the environment when [1mbash [22mstarts, the
              shell enters posix mode before reading the startup files,  as  if
              the  [1m--posix  [22minvocation  option had been supplied.  If it is set
              while the shell is running, [1mbash [22menables posix mode,  as  if  the
              command  “set -o posix” had been executed.  When the shell enters
              posix mode, it sets this variable if it was not already set.
       [1mPROMPT_COMMAND[0m
              If this variable is set, and is an array, the value of  each  set
              element  is  executed  as a command prior to issuing each primary
              prompt.  If this is set but not an array variable, its  value  is
              used as a command to execute instead.
       [1mPROMPT_DIRTRIM[0m
              If  set  to  a number greater than zero, the value is used as the
              number of trailing directory components to retain when  expanding
              the [1m\w [22mand [1m\W [22mprompt string escapes (see [1mPROMPTING [22mbelow).  Char‐
              acters removed are replaced with an ellipsis.
       [1mPS0    [22mThe value of this parameter is expanded (see [1mPROMPTING [22mbelow) and
              displayed  by  interactive shells after reading a command and be‐
              fore the command is executed.
       [1mPS1    [22mThe value of this parameter is expanded (see [1mPROMPTING [22mbelow) and
              used  as  the  primary  prompt  string.   The  default  value  is
              “\s-\v\$ ”.
       [1mPS2    [22mThe  value  of this parameter is expanded as with [1mPS1 [22mand used as
              the secondary prompt string.  The default is “> ”.
       [1mPS3    [22mThe value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the  [1mselect[0m
              command (see [1mSHELL GRAMMAR [22mabove).
       [1mPS4    [22mThe value of this parameter is expanded as with [1mPS1 [22mand the value
              is  printed before each command [1mbash [22mdisplays during an execution
              trace.  The first character of  the  expanded  value  of  [1mPS4  [22mis
              replicated  multiple  times,  as  necessary, to indicate multiple
              levels of indirection.  The default is “+ ”.
       [1mSHELL  [22mThis variable expands to the full pathname to the shell.   If  it
              is  not  set  when  the shell starts, [1mbash [22massigns to it the full
              pathname of the current user's login shell.
       [1mTIMEFORMAT[0m
              The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying
              how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with  the  [1mtime[0m
              reserved word should be displayed.  The [1m% [22mcharacter introduces an
              escape  sequence that is expanded to a time value or other infor‐
              mation.  The escape sequences and their meanings are as  follows;
              the brackets denote optional portions.
              [1m%%        [22mA literal [1m%[22m.
              [1m%[[4m[22mp[24m[1m][l]R  [22mThe elapsed time in seconds.
              [1m%[[4m[22mp[24m[1m][l]U  [22mThe number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.
              [1m%[[4m[22mp[24m[1m][l]S  [22mThe number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.
              [1m%P        [22mThe CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.

              The optional [4mp[24m is a digit specifying the [4mprecision[24m, the number of
              fractional  digits after a decimal point.  A value of 0 causes no
              decimal point or fraction to be output.  [1mtime [22mprints at most  six
              digits  after  the  decimal point; values of [4mp[24m greater than 6 are
              changed to 6.  If [4mp[24m is not specified, [1mtime  [22mprints  three  digits
              after the decimal point.

              The  optional  [1ml [22mspecifies a longer format, including minutes, of
              the form [4mMM[24mm[4mSS[24m.[4mFF[24ms.  The value of [4mp[24m determines whether or not the
              fraction is included.

              If this variable is not set, [1mbash [22macts as if  it  had  the  value
              [1m$'\nreal\t%3lR\nuser\t%3lU\nsys\t%3lS'[22m.   If  the  value is null,
              [1mbash [22mdoes not display any timing information.  A trailing newline
              is added when the format string is displayed.
       [1mTMOUT  [22mIf set to a value greater than zero, the [1mread  [22mbuiltin  uses  the
              value  as  its default timeout.  The [1mselect [22mcommand terminates if
              input does not arrive after [1mTMOUT [22mseconds when  input  is  coming
              from  a  terminal.   In an interactive shell, the value is inter‐
              preted as the number of seconds to wait for a line of input after
              issuing the primary prompt.  [1mBash [22mterminates  after  waiting  for
              that  number  of seconds if a complete line of input does not ar‐
              rive.
       [1mTMPDIR [22mIf set, [1mbash [22muses its value as the name of a directory  in  which
              [1mbash [22mcreates temporary files for the shell's use.
       [1mauto_resume[0m
              This  variable controls how the shell interacts with the user and
              job control.  If this variable is set, simple commands consisting
              of only a single word, without redirections, are treated as  can‐
              didates  for  resumption of an existing stopped job.  There is no
              ambiguity allowed; if there is more than one job  beginning  with
              or  containing  the word, this selects the most recently accessed
              job.  The [4mname[24m of a stopped job, in this context, is the  command
              line used to start it, as displayed by [1mjobs[22m.  If set to the value
              [4mexact[24m,  the word must match the name of a stopped job exactly; if
              set to [4msubstring[24m, the word needs to match a substring of the name
              of a stopped job.  The  [4msubstring[24m  value  provides  functionality
              analogous  to the [1m%?  [22mjob identifier (see [1mJOB CONTROL [22mbelow).  If
              set to any other value (e.g., [4mprefix[24m), the word must be a  prefix
              of a stopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous to
              the [1m%[4m[22mstring[24m job identifier.
       [1mhistchars[0m
              The  two  or  three  characters  which control history expansion,
              quick substitution, and tokenization (see [1mHISTORY  EXPANSION  [22mbe‐
              low).   The  first  character is the [4mhistory[24m [4mexpansion[24m character,
              the character which begins a  history  expansion,  normally  “[1m![22m”.
              The  second  character  is the [4mquick[24m [4msubstitution[24m character, nor‐
              mally “[1m^[22m”.  When it appears as the first character on  the  line,
              history  substitution repeats the previous command, replacing one
              string with another.  The optional third character is the [4mhistory[0m
              [4mcomment[24m character,  normally “[1m#[22m”, which indicates  that  the  re‐
              mainder  of  the  line  is a comment when it appears as the first
              character of a word.  The history comment character disables his‐
              tory substitution for the remaining words on the line.   It  does
              not  necessarily  cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the
              line as a comment.

   [1mArrays[0m
       [1mBash [22mprovides one-dimensional indexed and associative  array  variables.
       Any  variable  may  be used as an indexed array; the [1mdeclare [22mbuiltin ex‐
       plicitly declares an array.  There is no maximum limit on the size of an
       array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned  contigu‐
       ously.   Indexed arrays are referenced using arithmetic expressions that
       must expand to an integer (see  [1mARITHMETIC  EVALUATION  [22mbelow)  and  are
       zero-based;  associative  arrays are referenced using arbitrary strings.
       Unless otherwise noted, indexed array indices must be non-negative inte‐
       gers.

       The shell performs parameter and variable expansion,  arithmetic  expan‐
       sion,  command  substitution,  and  quote  removal on indexed array sub‐
       scripts.  Since this can potentially result in empty strings,  subscript
       indexing treats those as expressions that evaluate to 0.

       The  shell  performs  tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,
       arithmetic expansion, command substitution, and quote removal  on  asso‐
       ciative  array  subscripts.  Empty strings cannot be used as associative
       array keys.

       [1mBash [22mautomatically creates an indexed array if any variable is  assigned
       to using the syntax
              [4mname[24m[[4msubscript[24m]=[4mvalue[24m .
       The  [4msubscript[24m is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate
       to a number greater than or equal to zero.  To explicitly declare an in‐
       dexed array, use
              [1mdeclare -a [4m[22mname[0m
       (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).
              [1mdeclare -a [4m[22mname[24m[[4msubscript[24m]
       is also accepted; the [4msubscript[24m is ignored.

       Associative arrays are created using
              [1mdeclare -A [4m[22mname[0m
       .

       Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the [1mdeclare  [22mand
       [1mreadonly [22mbuiltins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.

       Arrays  are assigned using compound assignments of the form [4mname[24m=[1m([22mvalue[4m1[0m
       ... value[4mn[24m[1m)[22m, where each [4mvalue[24m may be  of  the  form  [[4msubscript[24m]=[4mstring[24m.
       Indexed  array  assignments  do  not  require anything but [4mstring[24m.  Each
       [4mvalue[24m in the list is expanded using the shell expansions described below
       under [1mEXPANSION[22m, but [4mvalue[24ms that are valid variable assignments  includ‐
       ing  the  brackets and subscript do not undergo brace expansion and word
       splitting, as with individual variable assignments.

       When assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets and subscript
       are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the ele‐
       ment assigned is the last index assigned to by the statement  plus  one.
       Indexing starts at zero.

       When  assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound assign‐
       ment may be either assignment statements, for which the subscript is re‐
       quired, or a list of words that is interpreted as a sequence  of  alter‐
       nating  keys and values: [4mname[24m=[1m( [4m[22mkey1[24m [4mvalue1[24m [4mkey2[24m [4mvalue2[24m ...[1m)[22m.  These are
       treated identically to [4mname[24m=[1m(  [22m[[4mkey1[24m]=[4mvalue1[24m  [[4mkey2[24m]=[4mvalue2[24m  ...[1m)[22m.   The
       first  word  in  the  list determines how the remaining words are inter‐
       preted; all assignments in a list must be of the same type.  When  using
       key/value  pairs,  the keys may not be missing or empty; a final missing
       value is treated like the empty string.

       This syntax is also accepted by the [1mdeclare [22mbuiltin.   Individual  array
       elements  may  be assigned to using the [4mname[24m[[4msubscript[24m]=[4mvalue[24m syntax in‐
       troduced above.

       When assigning to an indexed array, if [4mname[24m is subscripted by a negative
       number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater  than  the
       maximum  index  of  [4mname[24m, so negative indices count back from the end of
       the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

       The “+=” operator appends to an array variable when assigning using  the
       compound assignment syntax; see [1mPARAMETERS [22mabove.

       An array element is referenced using ${[4mname[24m[[4msubscript[24m]}.  The braces are
       required  to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If [4msubscript[24m is [1m@[0m
       or [1m*[22m, the word expands to all members of [4mname[24m, unless noted in  the  de‐
       scription  of a builtin or word expansion.  These subscripts differ only
       when the word appears within double quotes.   If  the  word  is  double-
       quoted, ${[4mname[24m[*]} expands to a single word with the value of each array
       member separated by the first character of the [1mIFS [22mspecial variable, and
       ${[4mname[24m[@]}  expands each element of [4mname[24m to a separate word.  When there
       are no array members, ${[4mname[24m[@]} expands to  nothing.   If  the  double-
       quoted  expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first para‐
       meter is joined with the beginning part of the expansion of the original
       word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined  with  the  last
       part  of  the  expansion of the original word.  This is analogous to the
       expansion of the special parameters [1m*  [22mand  [1m@  [22m(see  [1mSpecial  Parameters[0m
       above).

       ${#[4mname[24m[[4msubscript[24m]}  expands  to  the  length of ${[4mname[24m[[4msubscript[24m]}.  If
       [4msubscript[24m is [1m* [22mor [1m@[22m, the expansion is the number of elements in the  ar‐
       ray.

       If the [4msubscript[24m used to reference an element of an indexed array evalu‐
       ates  to  a  number less than zero, it is interpreted as relative to one
       greater than the maximum index of the array, so negative  indices  count
       back  from  the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last
       element.

       Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to  ref‐
       erencing  the  array with a subscript of 0.  Any reference to a variable
       using a valid subscript is valid; [1mbash [22mcreates an array if necessary.

       An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been  assigned  a
       value.  The null string is a valid value.

       It  is  possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as the
       values.  ${[1m![4m[22mname[24m[[4m@[24m]} and ${[1m![4m[22mname[24m[[4m*[24m]} expand to the indices  assigned  in
       array  variable [4mname[24m.  The treatment when in double quotes is similar to
       the expansion of the special parameters [4m@[24m and [4m*[24m within double quotes.

       The [1munset [22mbuiltin is used to destroy arrays.  [1munset [4m[22mname[24m[[4msubscript[24m]  un‐
       sets the array element at index [4msubscript[24m, for both indexed and associa‐
       tive  arrays.   Negative subscripts to indexed arrays are interpreted as
       described above.  Unsetting the last element of an array  variable  does
       not unset the variable.  [1munset [4m[22mname[24m, where [4mname[24m is an array, removes the
       entire  array.   [1munset  [4m[22mname[24m[[4msubscript[24m] behaves differently depending on
       whether [4mname[24m is an indexed or associative array when [4msubscript[24m is  [1m*  [22mor
       [1m@[22m.   If  [4mname[24m is an associative array, this unsets the element with sub‐
       script [1m* [22mor [1m@[22m.  If [4mname[24m is an indexed array, unset removes  all  of  the
       elements but does not remove the array itself.

       When using a variable name with a subscript as an argument to a command,
       such  as  with  [1munset[22m, without using the word expansion syntax described
       above, (e.g., unset a[4]), the argument is subject  to  pathname  expan‐
       sion.   Quote  the  argument if pathname expansion is not desired (e.g.,
       unset 'a[4]').

       The [1mdeclare[22m, [1mlocal[22m, and [1mreadonly [22mbuiltins each accept  a  [1m-a  [22moption  to
       specify  an  indexed array and a [1m-A [22moption to specify an associative ar‐
       ray.  If both options are  supplied,  [1m-A  [22mtakes  precedence.   The  [1mread[0m
       builtin  accepts  a  [1m-a  [22moption  to assign a list of words read from the
       standard input to an array.  The [1mset [22mand [1mdeclare [22mbuiltins display  array
       values  in  a  way  that allows them to be reused as assignments.  Other
       builtins accept array name arguments as well (e.g.,  [1mmapfile[22m);  see  the
       descriptions  of  individual builtins below for details.  The shell pro‐
       vides a number of builtin array variables.

[1mEXPANSION[0m
       Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split  into
       words.   The shell performs these expansions: [4mbrace[24m [4mexpansion[24m, [4mtilde[24m [4mex‐[0m
       [4mpansion[24m, [4mparameter[24m [4mand[24m [4mvariable[24m [4mexpansion[24m, [4mcommand[24m [4msubstitution[24m,  [4marith‐[0m
       [4mmetic[24m [4mexpansion[24m, [4mword[24m [4msplitting[24m, [4mpathname[24m [4mexpansion[24m, and [4mquote[24m [4mremoval[24m.

       The  order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter
       and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and  command  substitution
       (done  in  a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; pathname expansion;
       and quote removal.

       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion  avail‐
       able:  [4mprocess[24m  [4msubstitution[24m.   This  is  performed  at the same time as
       tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and command substi‐
       tution.

       [4mQuote[24m [4mremoval[24m is always performed last.   It  removes  quote  characters
       present  in  the original word, not ones resulting from one of the other
       expansions, unless they have been quoted themselves.

       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and  pathname  expansion  can  in‐
       crease  the  number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a
       single word to a single word.  The only exceptions to this are  the  ex‐
       pansions of [1m"$@" [22mand [1m"${[4m[22mname[24m[1m[@]}"[22m, and, in most cases, [1m$* [22mand [1m${[4m[22mname[24m[1m[*]}[0m
       as explained above (see [1mPARAMETERS[22m).

   [1mBrace Expansion[0m
       [4mBrace[24m  [4mexpansion[24m  is a mechanism to generate arbitrary strings sharing a
       common prefix and suffix, either of which can be empty.  This  mechanism
       is  similar  to [4mpathname[24m [4mexpansion[24m, but the filenames generated need not
       exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded are formed from an optional [4mpream‐[0m
       [4mble[24m, followed by either a series of comma-separated  strings  or  a  se‐
       quence  expression  between  a  pair  of braces, followed by an optional
       [4mpostscript[24m.  The preamble is prefixed to each  string  contained  within
       the  braces,  and  the  postscript  is  then  appended to each resulting
       string, expanding left to right.

       Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are
       not sorted; brace expansion preserves left to right order.  For example,
       a[1m{[22md,c,b[1m}[22me expands into “ade ace abe”.

       A sequence expression takes the form [4mx[24m[1m..[4m[22my[24m[1m[..[4m[22mincr[24m[1m][22m, where [4mx[24m and [4my[24m are ei‐
       ther integers or single letters, and [4mincr[24m, an optional increment, is  an
       integer.   When  integers  are  supplied, the expression expands to each
       number between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m, inclusive.  If either [4mx[24m or [4my[24m begins with a zero,
       each generated term will contain the same number of digits, zero-padding
       where necessary.  When letters are supplied, the expression  expands  to
       each character lexicographically between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m, inclusive, using the C
       locale.   Note  that  both  [4mx[24m and [4my[24m must be of the same type (integer or
       letter).  When the increment is supplied, it is used as  the  difference
       between each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.

       Brace  expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any char‐
       acters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.   It  is
       strictly  textual.   [1mBash [22mdoes not apply any syntactic interpretation to
       the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.

       A correctly-formed brace expansion must  contain  unquoted  opening  and
       closing  braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence ex‐
       pression.  Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged.

       A “{” or Q , may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being consid‐
       ered part of a brace expression.  To avoid conflicts with parameter  ex‐
       pansion, the string “${” is not considered eligible for brace expansion,
       and inhibits brace expansion until the closing “}”.

       This  construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of
       the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:

              mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
       or
              chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

       Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical ver‐
       sions of [1msh[22m.  [1msh [22mdoes not treat opening or closing braces specially when
       they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the  output.   [1mBash[0m
       removes  braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.  For ex‐
       ample, a word entered to [1msh [22mas “file{1,2}” appears  identically  in  the
       output.   [1mBash [22moutputs that word as “file1 file2” after brace expansion.
       Start [1mbash [22mwith the [1m+B [22moption or disable brace expansion with the [1m+B [22mop‐
       tion to the [1mset [22mcommand (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow) for strict [1msh[0m
       compatibility.

   [1mTilde Expansion[0m
       If a word begins with an unquoted tilde  character  (“[1m~[22m”),  all  of  the
       characters  preceding  the  first  unquoted slash (or all characters, if
       there is no unquoted slash) are considered a [4mtilde-prefix[24m.  If  none  of
       the  characters  in  the  tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the
       tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible  [4mlogin[24m  [4mname[24m.
       If  this  login  name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the
       value of the shell parameter [1mHOME[22m.  If [1mHOME [22mis unset, the tilde  expands
       to  the  home directory of the user executing the shell instead.  Other‐
       wise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the  home  directory  associated
       with the specified login name.

       If  the  tilde-prefix is a “~+”, the value of the shell variable [1mPWD [22mre‐
       places the tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a “~-”, the shell  sub‐
       stitutes  the  value of the shell variable [1mOLDPWD[22m, if it is set.  If the
       characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of  a  number
       [4mN[24m,  optionally  prefixed by a “+” or a “-”, the tilde-prefix is replaced
       with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would  be
       displayed  by the [1mdirs [22mbuiltin invoked with the characters following the
       tilde in the tilde-prefix as an argument.  If the  characters  following
       the  tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading “+”
       or “-”, tilde expansion assumes “+”.

       The results of tilde expansion are treated as if they  were  quoted,  so
       the replacement is not subject to word splitting and pathname expansion.

       If  the  login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the tilde-
       prefix is unchanged.

       [1mBash [22mchecks each variable assignment for unquoted tilde-prefixes immedi‐
       ately following a [1m: [22mor the first [1m=[22m,  and  performs  tilde  expansion  in
       these cases.  Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in assign‐
       ments  to [1mPATH[22m, [1mMAILPATH[22m, and [1mCDPATH[22m, and the shell assigns the expanded
       value.

       [1mBash [22malso performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the conditions of
       variable assignments (as described above under [1mPARAMETERS[22m) when they ap‐
       pear as arguments to simple commands.  [1mBash [22mdoes not do this, except for
       the [4mdeclaration[24m commands listed above, when in posix mode.

   [1mParameter Expansion[0m
       The “[1m$[22m” character introduces parameter expansion, command  substitution,
       or  arithmetic  expansion.   The parameter name or symbol to be expanded
       may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to  protect  the
       variable  to  be expanded from characters immediately following it which
       could be interpreted as part of the name.

       When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first “[1m}[22m” not es‐
       caped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an embed‐
       ded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter expansion.

       The basic form of parameter expansion is

       ${[4mparameter[24m}

       which substitutes the value of [4mparameter[24m.  The braces are required  when
       [4mparameter[24m  is  a  positional parameter with more than one digit, or when
       [4mparameter[24m is followed by a character which is not to be  interpreted  as
       part of its name.  The [4mparameter[24m is a shell parameter as described above
       [1mPARAMETERS[22m) or an array reference ([1mArrays[22m).

       If the first character of [4mparameter[24m is an exclamation point ([1m![22m), and [4mpa‐[0m
       [4mrameter[24m  is  not  a [4mnameref[24m, it introduces a level of indirection.  [1mBash[0m
       uses the value formed by expanding the rest of [4mparameter[24m as the new  [4mpa‐[0m
       [4mrameter[24m;  this  new parameter is then expanded and that value is used in
       the rest of the expansion, rather than the expansion of the original [4mpa‐[0m
       [4mrameter[24m.  This is known as [4mindirect[24m [4mexpansion[24m.  The value is subject  to
       tilde  expansion,  parameter expansion, command substitution, and arith‐
       metic expansion.  If [4mparameter[24m is a nameref, this expands to the name of
       the parameter referenced by [4mparameter[24m instead of performing the complete
       indirect expansion, for compatibility.  The exceptions to this  are  the
       expansions of ${[1m![4m[22mprefix[24m[1m*[22m} and ${[1m![4m[22mname[24m[[4m@[24m]} described below.  The exclama‐
       tion  point must immediately follow the left brace in order to introduce
       indirection.

       In each of the cases below, [4mword[24m is subject to tilde expansion,  parame‐
       ter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

       When  not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented be‐
       low (e.g., [1m:-[22m), [1mbash [22mtests for a parameter that is unset or null.  Omit‐
       ting the colon tests only for a parameter that is unset.

              [1mUse Default Values[22m.  If [4mparameter[24m is unset or null, the expansion
              of [4mword[24m is substituted.  Otherwise, the  value  of  [4mparameter[24m  is
              substituted.

       ${[4mparameter[24m[1m:=[4m[22mword[24m}
              [1mAssign Default Values[22m.  If [4mparameter[24m is unset or null, the expan‐
              sion  of  [4mword[24m is assigned to [4mparameter[24m, and the expansion is the
              final value of [4mparameter[24m.  Positional parameters and special  pa‐
              rameters may not be assigned in this way.

              the shell writes the expansion of [4mword[24m (or a message to that  ef‐
              fect  if [4mword[24m is not present) to the standard error and, if it is
              not interactive, exits with a non-zero  status.   An  interactive
              shell  does not exit, but does not execute the command associated
              with the expansion.  Otherwise, the value of [4mparameter[24m is substi‐
              tuted.

              substituted, otherwise the expansion of [4mword[24m is substituted.  The
              value of [4mparameter[24m is not used.

              [1mSubstring  Expansion[22m.   Expands to up to [4mlength[24m characters of the
              value of [4mparameter[24m starting at the character specified by [4moffset[24m.
              If [4mparameter[24m is [1m@ [22mor [1m*[22m, an indexed array subscripted by [1m@  [22mor  [1m*[22m,
              or an associative array name, the results differ as described be‐
              low.   If [1m:[4m[22mlength[24m is omitted (the first form above), this expands
              to the substring of the value of [4mparameter[24m starting at the  char‐
              acter  specified by [4moffset[24m and extending to the end of the value.
              If [4moffset[24m is omitted, it is treated as 0.  If [4mlength[24m is  omitted,
              but  the  colon  after  [4moffset[24m  is  present,  it is treated as 0.
              [4mlength[24m and [4moffset[24m  are  arithmetic  expressions  (see  [1mARITHMETIC[0m
              [1mEVALUATION [22mbelow).

              If [4moffset[24m evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used
              as  an  offset in characters from the end of the value of [4mparame‐[0m
              [4mter[24m.  If [4mlength[24m evaluates to a number less than zero, it  is  in‐
              terpreted as an offset in characters from the end of the value of
              [4mparameter[24m  rather  than a number of characters, and the expansion
              is the characters between [4moffset[24m and that result.   Note  that  a
              negative  offset must be separated from the colon by at least one
              space to avoid being confused with the [1m:- [22mexpansion.

              If [4mparameter[24m is [1m@ [22mor [1m*[22m, the result is [4mlength[24m  positional  parame‐
              ters beginning at [4moffset[24m.  A negative [4moffset[24m is taken relative to
              one  greater than the greatest positional parameter, so an offset
              of -1 evaluates to the last positional parameter (or 0  if  there
              are  no  positional  parameters).   It  is  an expansion error if
              [4mlength[24m evaluates to a number less than zero.

              If [4mparameter[24m is an indexed array name subscripted by @ or *,  the
              result  is the [4mlength[24m members of the array beginning with ${[4mpara‐[0m
              [4mmeter[24m[[4moffset[24m]}.  A negative  [4moffset[24m  is  taken  relative  to  one
              greater  than the maximum index of the specified array.  It is an
              expansion error if [4mlength[24m evaluates to a number less than zero.

              Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces  un‐
              defined results.

              Substring indexing is zero-based unless the positional parameters
              are  used, in which case the indexing starts at 1 by default.  If
              [4moffset[24m is 0, and the positional parameters are used, [1m$0  [22mis  pre‐
              fixed to the list.

              within double quotes, each variable name expands  to  a  separate
              word.

              list of array indices (keys) assigned in [4mname[24m.  If [4mname[24m is not an
              array, expands to 0 if [4mname[24m is set and null otherwise.  When [4m@[24m is
              used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each key ex‐
              pands to a separate word.

              is  an array name subscripted by [1m* [22mor [1m@[22m, the value substituted is
              the number of elements in the array.  If [4mparameter[24m is an  indexed

              terpreted as relative to one greater than the  maximum  index  of
              [4mparameter[24m, so negative indices count back from the end of the ar‐

              tern and matched against the expanded value of [4mparameter[24m  as  de‐
              scribed  under [1mPattern Matching [22mbelow.  The longest match of [4mpat‐[0m

              dergoes tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arith‐
              metic  expansion, command and process substitution, and quote re‐
              moval.

              In the first form above, only the first match  is  replaced.   If
              there  are two slashes separating [4mparameter[24m and [4mpattern[24m (the sec‐
              ond form above), all matches of [4mpattern[24m are replaced with [4mstring[24m.
              If [4mpattern[24m is preceded by [1m# [22m(the third form above), it must match
              at the beginning of the expanded value of [4mparameter[24m.  If  [4mpattern[0m
              is  preceded  by  [1m% [22m(the fourth form above), it must match at the
              end of the expanded value of [4mparameter[24m.

              If the expansion of  [4mstring[24m  is  null,  matches  of  [4mpattern[24m  are
              deleted and the [1m/ [22mfollowing [4mpattern[24m may be omitted.

              If  the  [1mpatsub_replacement  [22mshell option is enabled using [1mshopt[22m,
              any unquoted instances of [1m&  [22min  [4mstring[24m  are  replaced  with  the
              matching portion of [4mpattern[24m.

              Quoting  any part of [4mstring[24m inhibits replacement in the expansion
              of the quoted portion, including replacement  strings  stored  in
              shell variables.  Backslash escapes [1m& [22min [4mstring[24m; the backslash is
              removed in order to permit a literal [1m& [22min the replacement string.
              Backslash can also be used to escape a backslash; [1m\\ [22mresults in a
              literal  backslash in the replacement.  Users should take care if
              [4mstring[24m is double-quoted to avoid  unwanted  interactions  between
              the  backslash  and  double-quoting,  since backslash has special
              meaning within double quotes.  Pattern substitution performs  the
              check  for  unquoted  [1m& [22mafter expanding [4mstring[24m; shell programmers
              should quote any occurrences of [1m& [22mthey want to be taken literally
              in the replacement and ensure any instances of [1m& [22mthey want to  be
              replaced are unquoted.

              Like the pattern removal operators, double quotes surrounding the
              replacement  string  quote  the expanded characters, while double
              quotes enclosing the entire parameter substitution do not,  since
              the expansion is performed in a context that doesn't take any en‐
              closing double quotes into account.

              If  the  [1mnocasematch  [22mshell  option is enabled, the match is per‐
              formed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.

              If [4mparameter[24m is [1m@ [22mor [1m*[22m, the substitution operation is applied  to
              each  positional  parameter in turn, and the expansion is the re‐

              against [4mpattern[24m as described below.  If a character  matches  the
              pattern,  its  case is converted.  The pattern should not attempt
              to match more than one character.

              Using “^” converts lowercase letters matching [4mpattern[24m  to  upper‐
              case;  “,” converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase.  The
              [1m^ [22mand [1m, [22mvariants examine the  first  character  in  the  expanded
              value  and  convert its case if it matches [4mpattern[24m; the [1m^^ [22mand [1m,,[0m
              variants examine all characters in the expanded value and convert
              each one that matches [4mpattern[24m.  If  [4mpattern[24m  is  omitted,  it  is
              treated like a [1m?[22m, which matches every character.

              If  [4mparameter[24m  is  [1m@ [22mor [1m*[22m, the case modification operation is ap‐
              plied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion  is
              the  resultant  list.   If  [4mparameter[24m  is  an array variable sub‐
              scripted with [1m@ [22mor [1m*[22m, the case modification operation is  applied
              to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the re‐
              sultant list.

                     ciative  arrays  as  a  sequence of quoted key-value pairs
                     (see [1mArrays [22mabove).  The keys and values are quoted  in  a
                     format that can be reused as input.

              If [4mparameter[24m is [1m@ [22mor [1m*[22m, the operation is applied  to  each  posi‐
              tional  parameter  in  turn,  and  the expansion is the resultant
              list.  If [4mparameter[24m is an array variable subscripted with [1m@ [22mor [1m*[22m,
              the operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and
              the expansion is the resultant list.

              The result of the expansion is  subject  to  word  splitting  and
              pathname expansion as described below.

   [1mCommand Substitution[0m
       [4mCommand[24m  [4msubstitution[24m allows the output of a command to replace the com‐
       mand itself.  There are two standard forms:

              [1m$([4m[22mcommand[24m[1m)[0m
       or (deprecated)
              [1m`[4m[22mcommand[24m[1m`[22m.

       [1mBash [22mperforms the expansion by executing [4mcommand[24m in a subshell  environ‐
       ment  and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of
       the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.  Embedded newlines  are
       not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.  The command
       substitution  [1m$(cat  [4m[22mfile[24m[1m)  [22mcan be replaced by the equivalent but faster
       [1m$(< [4m[22mfile[24m[1m)[22m.

       With the old-style backquote form of substitution, backslash retains its
       literal meaning except when followed by [1m$[22m, [1m`[22m, or [1m\[22m.  The first backquote
       not preceded by a backslash terminates the command  substitution.   When
       using  the  $([4mcommand[24m) form, all characters between the parentheses make
       up the command; none are treated specially.

       There is an alternate form of command substitution:

              [1m${[4m[22mc[24m [4mcommand[24m[1m;}[0m

       which executes [4mcommand[24m in the current execution environment and captures
       its output, again with trailing newlines removed.

       The character [4mc[24m following the open brace must be a space, tab,  newline,
       or  [1m|[22m,  and  the close brace must be in a position where a reserved word
       may appear (i.e., preceded by a command terminator such  as  semicolon).
       [1mBash  [22mallows the close brace to be joined to the remaining characters in
       the word without being followed by a shell metacharacter as  a  reserved
       word would usually require.

       Any  side effects of [4mcommand[24m take effect immediately in the current exe‐
       cution environment and persist in the current environment after the com‐
       mand completes (e.g., the [1mexit [22mbuiltin exits the shell).

       This type of command substitution superficially resembles  executing  an
       unnamed  shell  function:  local  variables  are created as when a shell
       function is executing, and the [1mreturn [22mbuiltin  forces  [4mcommand[24m  to  com‐
       plete; however, the rest of the execution environment, including the po‐
       sitional parameters, is shared with the caller.

       If  the  first  character following the open brace is a [1m|[22m, the construct
       expands to the value of the [1mREPLY [22mshell variable after [4mcommand[24m executes,
       without removing any trailing newlines, and the standard output of  [4mcom‐[0m
       [4mmand[24m remains the same as in the calling shell.  [1mBash [22mcreates [1mREPLY [22mas an
       initially-unset local variable when [4mcommand[24m executes, and restores [1mREPLY[0m
       to  the  value it had before the command substitution after [4mcommand[24m com‐
       pletes, as with any local variable.

       Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the  backquoted
       form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.

       If  the substitution appears within double quotes, [1mbash [22mdoes not perform
       word splitting and pathname expansion on the results.

   [1mArithmetic Expansion[0m
       Arithmetic expansion evaluates an arithmetic expression and  substitutes
       the result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is:

              [1m$(([4m[22mexpression[24m[1m))[0m

       The [4mexpression[24m undergoes the same expansions as if it were within double
       quotes,  but  unescaped  double  quote  characters in [4mexpression[24m are not
       treated specially and are removed.  All tokens in the expression undergo
       parameter and variable expansion, command substitution,  and  quote  re‐
       moval.   The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be evalu‐
       ated.  Since the way Bash handles double quotes can  potentially  result
       in  empty strings, arithmetic expansion treats those as expressions that
       evaluate to 0.  Arithmetic expansions may be nested.

       The evaluation is performed according to the rules  listed  below  under
       [1mARITHMETIC  EVALUATION[22m.  If [4mexpression[24m is invalid, [1mbash [22mprints a message
       to standard error indicating failure, does not perform the substitution,
       and does not execute the command associated with the expansion.

   [1mProcess Substitution[0m
       [4mProcess[24m [4msubstitution[24m allows a process's input or output to  be  referred
       to  using  a  filename.   It  takes the form of [1m<([4m[22mlist[24m[1m) [22mor [1m>([4m[22mlist[24m[1m)[22m.  The
       process [4mlist[24m is run asynchronously, and its input or output appears as a
       filename.  This filename is passed as an argument to the current command
       as the result of the expansion.

       If the [1m>([4m[22mlist[24m[1m) [22mform is used, writing to  the  file  provides  input  for
       [4mlist[24m.   If the [1m<([4m[22mlist[24m[1m) [22mform is used, reading the file obtains the output
       of [4mlist[24m.  No space may appear between the [1m< [22mor [1m> [22mand the left  parenthe‐
       sis, otherwise the construct would be interpreted as a redirection.

       Process  substitution  is  supported on systems that support named pipes
       ([4mFIFOs[24m) or the [4m/dev/fd[24m method of naming open files.

       When available, process substitution is  performed  simultaneously  with
       parameter  and  variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
       expansion.

   [1mWord Splitting[0m
       The shell scans the results of parameter  expansion,  command  substitu‐
       tion,  and  arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes
       for [4mword[24m [4msplitting[24m.  Words that were not expanded are not split.

       The shell treats each character of [1mIFS [22mas a delimiter,  and  splits  the
       results  of  the  other  expansions into words using these characters as
       field terminators.

       An [4mIFS[24m [4mwhitespace[24m character is whitespace as defined above (see  [1mDefini‐[0m
       [1mtions[22m)  that  appears  in the value of [1mIFS[22m.  Space, tab, and newline are
       always considered IFS whitespace, even if they don't appear in  the  lo‐
       cale's [1mspace [22mcategory.

       If   [1mIFS   [22mis   unset,  field  splitting  acts  as  if  its  value  were
       [1m<space><tab><newline>[22m, and treats these characters  as  IFS  whitespace.
       If the value of [1mIFS [22mis null, no word splitting occurs, but implicit null
       arguments (see below) are still removed.

       Word splitting begins by removing sequences of IFS whitespace characters
       from  the  beginning  and end of the results of the previous expansions,
       then splits the remaining words.

       If the value of [1mIFS [22mconsists solely of IFS whitespace, any  sequence  of
       IFS whitespace characters delimits a field, so a field consists of char‐
       acters that are not unquoted IFS whitespace, and null fields result only
       from quoting.

       If  [1mIFS  [22mcontains  a non-whitespace character, then any character in the
       value of [1mIFS [22mthat is not IFS whitespace, along  with  any  adjacent  IFS
       whitespace  characters, delimits a field.  This means that adjacent non-
       IFS-whitespace delimiters produce a  null  field.   A  sequence  of  IFS
       whitespace characters also delimits a field.

       Explicit  null  arguments ([1m"" [22mor [1m''[22m) are retained and passed to commands
       as empty strings.  Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from  the
       expansion  of  parameters that have no values, are removed.  Expanding a
       parameter with no value within double  quotes  produces  a  null  field,
       which is retained and passed to a command as an empty string.

       When a quoted null argument appears as part of a word whose expansion is
       non-null,  word splitting removes the null argument portion, leaving the
       non-null expansion.  That is, the word “-d''” becomes  “-d”  after  word
       splitting and null argument removal.

   [1mPathname Expansion[0m
       After word splitting, unless the [1m-f [22moption has been set, [1mbash [22mscans each
       word  for  the  characters  [1m*[22m, [1m?[22m, and [1m[[22m.  If one of these characters ap‐
       pears, and is not quoted, then the word is regarded as  a  [4mpattern[24m,  and
       replaced  with a sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see [1mPat‐[0m
       [1mtern Matching [22mbelow) subject to the value of the  [1mGLOBSORT  [22mshell  vari‐
       able.

       If no matching filenames are found, and the shell option [1mnullglob [22mis not
       enabled, the word is left unchanged.  If the [1mnullglob [22moption is set, and
       no matches are found, the word is removed.  If the [1mfailglob [22mshell option
       is  set, and no matches are found, [1mbash [22mprints an error message and does
       not execute the command.  If the shell option [1mnocaseglob [22mis enabled, the
       match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.

       When a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the character “.” at  the
       start of a name or immediately following a slash must be matched explic‐
       itly,  unless  the  shell  option [1mdotglob [22mis set.  In order to match the
       filenames [4m.[24m and [4m..[24m, the pattern must begin with “.” (for example, “.?”),
       even if [1mdotglob [22mis set.  If the [1mglobskipdots [22mshell  option  is  enabled,
       the  filenames  [4m.[24m  and [4m..[24m never match, even if the pattern begins with a
       “.”.  When not matching pathnames, the “.” character is not treated spe‐
       cially.

       When matching a pathname, the slash character must always be matched ex‐
       plicitly by a slash in the pattern, but in other  matching  contexts  it
       can  be  matched by a special pattern character as described below under
       [1mPattern Matching[22m.

       See the description of [1mshopt [22mbelow under [1mSHELL BUILTIN  COMMANDS  [22mfor  a
       description  of  the  [1mnocaseglob[22m,  [1mnullglob[22m, [1mglobskipdots[22m, [1mfailglob[22m, and
       [1mdotglob [22mshell options.

       The [1mGLOBIGNORE [22mshell variable may be used to restrict the  set  of  file
       names matching a [4mpattern[24m.  If [1mGLOBIGNORE [22mis set, each matching file name
       that  also matches one of the patterns in [1mGLOBIGNORE [22mis removed from the
       list of matches.  If the [1mnocaseglob [22moption is set, the matching  against
       the  patterns  in  [1mGLOBIGNORE  [22mis performed without regard to case.  The
       filenames [4m.[24m and [4m..[24m are always ignored when [1mGLOBIGNORE  [22mis  set  and  not
       null.  However, setting [1mGLOBIGNORE [22mto a non-null value has the effect of
       enabling the [1mdotglob [22mshell option, so all other filenames beginning with
       a  “.”  match.   To get the old behavior of ignoring filenames beginning
       with a “.”, make “.*”  one of the patterns in [1mGLOBIGNORE[22m.   The  [1mdotglob[0m
       option  is  disabled  when  [1mGLOBIGNORE [22mis unset.  The [1mGLOBIGNORE [22mpattern
       matching honors the setting of the [1mextglob [22mshell option.

       The value of the [1mGLOBSORT [22mshell variable controls  how  the  results  of
       pathname expansion are sorted, as described above under [1mShell Variables[22m.

       [1mPattern Matching[0m

       Any  character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern
       characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL character  may  not
       occur  in  a  pattern.  A backslash escapes the following character; the
       escaping backslash is discarded  when  matching.   The  special  pattern
       characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.

       The special pattern characters have the following meanings:

              [1m*      [22mMatches  any  string, including the null string.  When the
                     [1mglobstar [22mshell option is enabled, and [1m* [22mis used in a path‐
                     name expansion context, two adjacent [1m*[22ms used as  a  single
                     pattern  match  all files and zero or more directories and
                     subdirectories.  If followed by a [1m/[22m, two adjacent [1m*[22ms match
                     only directories and subdirectories.
              [1m?      [22mMatches any single character.
              [1m[[22m...[1m]  [22mMatches any one of the  characters  enclosed  between  the
                     brackets.   This  is  known  as  a  [4mbracket[24m [4mexpression[24m and
                     matches a single character.  A pair  of  characters  sepa‐
                     rated  by a hyphen denotes a [4mrange[24m [4mexpression[24m; any charac‐
                     ter that falls between those  two  characters,  inclusive,
                     using  the current locale's collating sequence and charac‐
                     ter set, matches.  If the first character following the  [1m[[0m
                     is  a  [1m!   [22mor  a [1m^ [22mthen any character not within the range
                     matches.  To match a [1m-[22m, include it as the  first  or  last
                     character  in  the  set.   To match a [1m][22m, include it as the
                     first character in the set.

                     the  characters  included  in the range, are determined by
                     the current locale and the values  of  the  [1mLC_COLLATE  [22mor
                     [1mLC_ALL [22mshell variables, if set.  To obtain the traditional
                     interpretation of range expressions, where [1m[a-d] [22mis equiv‐
                     alent to [1m[abcd][22m, set the value of the [1mLC_COLLATE [22mor [1mLC_ALL[0m
                     shell  variables to [1mC[22m, or enable the [1mglobasciiranges [22mshell
                     option.

                     Within a bracket  expression,  [4mcharacter[24m  [4mclasses[24m  can  be
                     specified  using  the syntax [1m[:[4m[22mclass[24m[1m:][22m, where [4mclass[24m is one
                     of the following classes defined in the POSIX standard:

                     [1malnum alpha ascii blank  cntrl  digit  graph  lower  print[0m
                     [1mpunct space upper word xdigit[0m

                     A  character class matches any character belonging to that
                     class.  The [1mword [22mcharacter class matches letters,  digits,
                     and the character _.

                     Within  a  bracket expression, an [4mequivalence[24m [4mclass[24m can be
                     specified using the syntax [1m[=[4m[22mc[24m[1m=][22m, which matches all  char‐
                     acters  with  the same collation weight (as defined by the
                     current locale) as the character [4mc[24m.

                     Within a bracket expression, the syntax [1m[.[4m[22msymbol[24m[1m.] [22mmatches
                     the collating symbol [4msymbol[24m.

       If the [1mextglob [22mshell option is enabled  using  the  [1mshopt  [22mbuiltin,  the
       shell  recognizes  several  extended pattern matching operators.  In the
       following description, a [4mpattern-list[24m is a list of one or more  patterns
       separated by a [1m|[22m.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of
       the following sub-patterns:

              [1m?([4m[22mpattern-list[24m[1m)[0m
                     Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns.
              [1m*([4m[22mpattern-list[24m[1m)[0m
                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns.
              [1m+([4m[22mpattern-list[24m[1m)[0m
                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns.
              [1m@([4m[22mpattern-list[24m[1m)[0m
                     Matches one of the given patterns.
              [1m!([4m[22mpattern-list[24m[1m)[0m
                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns.

       The  [1mextglob [22moption changes the behavior of the parser, since the paren‐
       theses are normally treated as operators with syntactic meaning.  To en‐
       sure that extended matching patterns are  parsed  correctly,  make  sure
       that  [1mextglob  [22mis  enabled before parsing constructs containing the pat‐
       terns, including shell functions and command substitutions.

       When matching filenames, the [1mdotglob [22mshell option determines the set  of
       filenames that are tested: when [1mdotglob [22mis enabled, the set of filenames
       includes all files beginning with “.”, but [4m.[24m and [4m..[24m must be matched by a
       pattern  or sub-pattern that begins with a dot; when it is disabled, the
       set does not include any filenames beginning with “.” unless the pattern
       or sub-pattern begins with a “.”.  If the [1mglobskipdots [22mshell  option  is
       enabled,  the filenames [4m.[24m and [4m..[24m never appear in the set.  As above, “.”
       only has a special meaning when matching filenames.

       Complicated extended pattern matching against long strings is slow,  es‐
       pecially  when the patterns contain alternations and the strings contain
       multiple matches.  Using separate matches against  shorter  strings,  or
       using arrays of strings instead of a single long string, may be faster.

   [1mQuote Removal[0m
       After  the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the charac‐
       ters [1m\[22m, [1m'[22m, and [1m" [22mthat did not result from one of  the  above  expansions
       are removed.

[1mREDIRECTION[0m
       Before a command is executed, its input and output may be [4mredirected[24m us‐
       ing  a  special  notation  interpreted by the shell.  [4mRedirection[24m allows
       commands' file handles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made  to  refer
       to  different files, and can change the files the command reads from and
       writes to.  When used with the [1mexec [22mbuiltin,  redirections  modify  file
       handles in the current shell execution environment.  The following redi‐
       rection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a [4msimple[24m [4mcommand[0m
       or  may  follow a [4mcommand[24m.  Redirections are processed in the order they
       appear, from left to right.

       Each redirection that may be preceded by a file  descriptor  number  may
       instead  be preceded by a word of the form {[4mvarname[24m}.  In this case, for
       each redirection operator except [1m>&- [22mand [1m<&-[22m, the shell allocates a file
       descriptor greater than or equal to 10 and assigns it  to  [4mvarname[24m.   If
       {[4mvarname[24m} precedes [1m>&- [22mor [1m<&-[22m, the value of [4mvarname[24m defines the file de‐
       scriptor  to  close.  If {[4mvarname[24m} is supplied, the redirection persists
       beyond the scope of the command, which allows the  shell  programmer  to
       manage  the  file  descriptor's lifetime manually without using the [1mexec[0m
       builtin.  The [1mvarredir_close [22mshell option manages this behavior.

       In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted,
       and the first character of the redirection operator is “<”, the redirec‐
       tion refers to the standard input (file descriptor  0).   If  the  first
       character  of the redirection operator is “>”, the redirection refers to
       the standard output (file descriptor 1).

       The [4mword[24m following the redirection operator in  the  following  descrip‐
       tions,  unless  otherwise  noted, is subjected to brace expansion, tilde
       expansion,  parameter  and  variable  expansion,  command  substitution,
       arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word split‐
       ting.  If it expands to more than one word, [1mbash [22mreports an error.

       The order of redirections is significant.  For example, the command

              ls [1m> [22mdirlist 2[1m>&[22m1

       directs  both  standard  output  and standard error to the file [4mdirlist[24m,
       while the command

              ls 2[1m>&[22m1 [1m> [22mdirlist

       directs only the standard output to file [4mdirlist[24m, because  the  standard
       error was directed to the standard output before the standard output was
       redirected to [4mdirlist[24m.

       [1mBash  [22mhandles several filenames specially when they are used in redirec‐
       tions, as described in the following table.  If the operating system  on
       which [1mbash [22mis running provides these special files, [1mbash [22muses them; oth‐
       erwise it emulates them internally with the behavior described below.

              [1m/dev/fd/[4m[22mfd[0m
                     If [4mfd[24m is a valid integer, duplicate file descriptor [4mfd[24m.
              [1m/dev/stdin[0m
                     File descriptor 0 is duplicated.
              [1m/dev/stdout[0m
                     File descriptor 1 is duplicated.
              [1m/dev/stderr[0m
                     File descriptor 2 is duplicated.
              [1m/dev/tcp/[4m[22mhost[24m[1m/[4m[22mport[0m
                     If  [4mhost[24m is a valid hostname or Internet address, and [4mport[0m
                     is an integer port number or service name,  [1mbash  [22mattempts
                     to open the corresponding TCP socket.
              [1m/dev/udp/[4m[22mhost[24m[1m/[4m[22mport[0m
                     If  [4mhost[24m is a valid hostname or Internet address, and [4mport[0m
                     is an integer port number or service name,  [1mbash  [22mattempts
                     to open the corresponding UDP socket.

       A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.

       Redirections  using  file descriptors greater than 9 should be used with
       care, as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell  uses  inter‐
       nally.

   [1mRedirecting Input[0m
       Redirecting  input  opens the file whose name results from the expansion
       of [4mword[24m for reading on file descriptor [4mn[24m, or the  standard  input  (file
       descriptor 0) if [4mn[24m is not specified.

       The general format for redirecting input is:

              [[4mn[24m][1m<[4m[22mword[0m

   [1mRedirecting Output[0m
       Redirecting  output opens the file whose name results from the expansion
       of [4mword[24m for writing on file descriptor [4mn[24m, or the standard  output  (file
       descriptor  1)  if [4mn[24m is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is
       created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.

       The general format for redirecting output is:

              [[4mn[24m][1m>[4m[22mword[0m

       If the redirection operator is [1m>[22m, and the [1mnoclobber [22moption  to  the  [1mset[0m
       builtin  command  has  been  enabled,  the redirection fails if the file
       whose name results from the expansion of [4mword[24m exists and  is  a  regular
       file.  If the redirection operator is [1m>|[22m, or the redirection operator is
       [1m>  [22mand  the [1mnoclobber [22moption to the [1mset [22mbuiltin is not enabled, [1mbash [22mat‐
       tempts the redirection even if the file named by [4mword[24m exists.

   [1mAppending Redirected Output[0m
       Redirecting output in this fashion opens the  file  whose  name  results
       from  the  expansion  of [4mword[24m for appending on file descriptor [4mn[24m, or the
       standard output (file descriptor 1) if [4mn[24m is not specified.  If the  file
       does not exist it is created.

       The general format for appending output is:

              [[4mn[24m][1m>>[4m[22mword[0m

   [1mRedirecting Standard Output and Standard Error[0m
       This  construct  redirects  both the standard output (file descriptor 1)
       and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to the file whose name
       is the expansion of [4mword[24m.

       There are two formats for redirecting standard output and  standard  er‐
       ror:

              [1m&>[4m[22mword[0m
       and
              [1m>&[4m[22mword[0m

       Of  the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is semantically equiva‐
       lent to

              [1m>[4m[22mword[24m 2[1m>&[22m1

       When using the second form, [4mword[24m may not expand to a number or [1m-[22m.  If it
       does, other redirection operators apply (see [1mDuplicating  File  Descrip‐[0m
       [1mtors [22mbelow) for compatibility reasons.

   [1mAppending Standard Output and Standard Error[0m
       This  construct appends both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and
       the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to the file whose name  is
       the expansion of [4mword[24m.

       The format for appending standard output and standard error is:

              [1m&>>[4m[22mword[0m

       This is semantically equivalent to

              [1m>>[4m[22mword[24m 2[1m>&[22m1

       (see [1mDuplicating File Descriptors [22mbelow).

   [1mHere Documents[0m
       This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the cur‐
       rent  source  until  it  reads a line containing only [4mdelimiter[24m (with no
       trailing blanks).  All of the lines read up to that  point  then  become
       the  standard  input (or file descriptor [4mn[24m if [4mn[24m is specified) for a com‐
       mand.

       The format of here-documents is:

              [[4mn[24m][1m<<[22m[[1m-[22m][4mword[0m
                      [4mhere-document[0m
              [4mdelimiter[0m

       The shell does not perform parameter  and  variable  expansion,  command
       substitution, arithmetic expansion, or pathname expansion on [4mword[24m.

       If  any part of [4mword[24m is quoted, the [4mdelimiter[24m is the result of quote re‐
       moval on [4mword[24m, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded.   If
       [4mword[24m  is  unquoted,  the [4mdelimiter[24m is [4mword[24m itself, and the here-document
       text is treated similarly to a double-quoted string: all  lines  of  the
       here-document  are  subjected  to parameter expansion, command substitu‐
       tion, and arithmetic expansion, the  character  sequence  [1m\<newline>  [22mis
       treated  literally, and [1m\ [22mmust be used to quote the characters [1m\[22m, [1m$[22m, and
       [1m`[22m; however, double quote characters have no special meaning.

       If the redirection operator is [1m<<-[22m, then the shell  strips  all  leading
       tab characters from input lines and the line containing [4mdelimiter[24m.  This
       allows  here-documents  within shell scripts to be indented in a natural
       fashion.

       If the delimiter is not quoted, the [1m\<newline> [22msequence is treated as  a
       line continuation: the two lines are joined and the backslash-newline is
       removed.  This happens while reading the here-document, before the check
       for the ending delimiter, so joined lines can form the end delimiter.

   [1mHere Strings[0m
       A variant of here documents, the format is:

              [[4mn[24m][1m<<<[4m[22mword[0m

       The  [4mword[24m  undergoes  tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,
       command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal.  Pathname
       expansion and word splitting are not performed.  The result is  supplied
       as a single string, with a newline appended, to the command on its stan‐
       dard input (or file descriptor [4mn[24m if [4mn[24m is specified).

   [1mDuplicating File Descriptors[0m
       The redirection operator

              [[4mn[24m][1m<&[4m[22mword[0m

       is  used to duplicate input file descriptors.  If [4mword[24m expands to one or
       more digits, file descriptor [4mn[24m is made to be a copy  of  that  file  de‐
       scriptor.   It is a redirection error if the digits in [4mword[24m do not spec‐
       ify a file descriptor open for input.  If [4mword[24m evaluates to [1m-[22m, file  de‐
       scriptor [4mn[24m is closed.  If [4mn[24m is not specified, this uses the standard in‐
       put (file descriptor 0).

       The operator

              [[4mn[24m][1m>&[4m[22mword[0m

       is  used  similarly  to  duplicate output file descriptors.  If [4mn[24m is not
       specified, this uses the standard output (file descriptor 1).  It  is  a
       redirection error if the digits in [4mword[24m do not specify a file descriptor
       open  for  output.  If [4mword[24m evaluates to [1m-[22m, file descriptor [4mn[24m is closed.
       As a special case, if [4mn[24m is omitted, and [4mword[24m does not expand to  one  or
       more  digits or [1m-[22m, this redirects the standard output and standard error
       as described previously.

   [1mMoving File Descriptors[0m
       The redirection operator

              [[4mn[24m][1m<&[4m[22mdigit[24m[1m-[0m

       moves the file descriptor [4mdigit[24m to file descriptor [4mn[24m,  or  the  standard
       input  (file descriptor 0) if [4mn[24m is not specified.  [4mdigit[24m is closed after
       being duplicated to [4mn[24m.

       Similarly, the redirection operator

              [[4mn[24m][1m>&[4m[22mdigit[24m[1m-[0m

       moves the file descriptor [4mdigit[24m to file descriptor [4mn[24m,  or  the  standard
       output (file descriptor 1) if [4mn[24m is not specified.

   [1mOpening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing[0m
       The redirection operator

              [[4mn[24m][1m<>[4m[22mword[0m

       opens  the file whose name is the expansion of [4mword[24m for both reading and
       writing on file descriptor [4mn[24m, or on file descriptor 0 if [4mn[24m is not speci‐
       fied.  If the file does not exist, it is created.

[1mALIASES[0m
       [4mAliases[24m allow a string to be substituted for a word that is in  a  posi‐
       tion  in  the  input where it can be the first word of a simple command.
       Aliases have names and corresponding values that are set and unset using
       the [1malias [22mand [1munalias [22mbuiltin commands (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN  COMMANDS  [22mbe‐
       low).

       If the shell reads an unquoted word in the right position, it checks the
       word  to  see if it matches an alias name.  If it matches, the shell re‐
       places the word with the alias value, and reads that value as if it  had
       been read instead of the word.  The shell doesn't look at any characters
       following the word before attempting alias substitution.

       The  characters  [1m/[22m,  [1m$[22m,  [1m`[22m, and [1m= [22mand any of the shell [4mmetacharacters[24m or
       quoting characters listed above may not appear in an  alias  name.   The
       replacement  text  may  contain  any  valid shell input, including shell
       metacharacters.  The first word of the replacement text  is  tested  for
       aliases,  but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not
       expanded a second time.  This means that one may alias [1mls [22mto [1mls -F[22m,  for
       instance,  and  [1mbash  [22mdoes not try to recursively expand the replacement
       text.

       If the last character of the alias value is a [4mblank[24m,  the  shell  checks
       the next command word following the alias for alias expansion.

       Aliases  are created and listed with the [1malias [22mcommand, and removed with
       the [1munalias [22mcommand.

       There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement  text.   If
       arguments  are  needed,  use  a shell function (see [1mFUNCTIONS [22mbelow) in‐
       stead.

       Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive,  unless  the
       [1mexpand_aliases  [22mshell  option is set using [1mshopt [22m(see the description of
       [1mshopt [22munder [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).

       The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat con‐
       fusing.  [1mBash [22malways reads at least one complete line of input, and  all
       lines  that make up a compound command, before executing any of the com‐
       mands on that line or the compound command.  Aliases are expanded when a
       command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an  alias  defini‐
       tion  appearing on the same line as another command does not take effect
       until the shell reads the next line of input, and an alias definition in
       a compound command does not take effect until the shell parses and  exe‐
       cutes the entire compound command.  The commands following the alias de‐
       finition on that line, or in the rest of a compound command, are not af‐
       fected  by the new alias.  This behavior is also an issue when functions
       are executed.  Aliases are expanded when a function definition is  read,
       not  when the function is executed, because a function definition is it‐
       self a command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not
       available until after that function is executed.  To be safe, always put
       alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use [1malias  [22min  compound
       commands.

       For almost every purpose, shell functions are preferable to aliases.

[1mFUNCTIONS[0m
       A shell function, defined as described above under [1mSHELL GRAMMAR[22m, stores
       a  series  of  commands  for  later execution.  When the name of a shell
       function is used as a simple command name, the shell executes  the  list
       of  commands associated with that function name.  Functions are executed
       in the context of the calling shell; there is no new process created  to
       interpret them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script).

       When  a  function  is executed, the arguments to the function become the
       positional parameters during its execution.  The special parameter [1m#  [22mis
       updated  to  reflect the new positional parameters.  Special parameter [1m0[0m
       is unchanged.  The first element of the [1mFUNCNAME [22mvariable is set to  the
       name of the function while the function is executing.

       All  other  aspects of the shell execution environment are identical be‐
       tween a function and its caller with these exceptions: the [1mDEBUG [22mand [1mRE‐[0m
       [1mTURN [22mtraps (see the description of the [1mtrap [22mbuiltin under [1mSHELL  BUILTIN[0m
       [1mCOMMANDS [22mbelow) are not inherited unless the function has been given the
       [1mtrace  [22mattribute  (see  the description of the [1mdeclare [22mbuiltin below) or
       the [1m-o functrace [22mshell option has been enabled with the [1mset [22mbuiltin  (in
       which  case  all  functions inherit the [1mDEBUG [22mand [1mRETURN [22mtraps), and the
       [1mERR [22mtrap is not inherited unless the [1m-o errtrace [22mshell option  has  been
       enabled.

       Variables local to the function are declared with the [1mlocal [22mbuiltin com‐
       mand  ([4mlocal[24m  [4mvariables[24m).   Ordinarily,  variables  and their values are
       shared between the function and its caller.  If a variable  is  declared
       [1mlocal[22m,  the  variable's visible scope is restricted to that function and
       its children (including the functions it calls).

       In the following description, the [4mcurrent[24m [4mscope[24m is a currently-  execut‐
       ing  function.  Previous scopes consist of that function's caller and so
       on, back to the “global” scope, where the shell  is  not  executing  any
       shell function.  A local variable at the current scope is a variable de‐
       clared  using the [1mlocal [22mor [1mdeclare [22mbuiltins in the function that is cur‐
       rently executing.

       Local variables “shadow” variables with the same name declared at previ‐
       ous scopes.  For instance, a local variable declared in a function hides
       variables with the same name  declared  at  previous  scopes,  including
       global  variables:  references  and assignments refer to the local vari‐
       able, leaving the variables at previous  scopes  unmodified.   When  the
       function returns, the global variable is once again visible.

       The shell uses [4mdynamic[24m [4mscoping[24m to control a variable's visibility within
       functions.  With dynamic scoping, visible variables and their values are
       a  result  of  the  sequence  of function calls that caused execution to
       reach the current function.  The value of a  variable  that  a  function
       sees depends on its value within its caller, if any, whether that caller
       is  the  global scope or another shell function.  This is also the value
       that a local variable declaration shadows, and the  value  that  is  re‐
       stored when the function returns.

       For  example,  if a variable [4mvar[24m is declared as local in function [4mfunc1[24m,
       and [4mfunc1[24m calls another function [4mfunc2[24m,  references  to  [4mvar[24m  made  from
       within [4mfunc2[24m resolve to the local variable [4mvar[24m from [4mfunc1[24m, shadowing any
       global variable named [4mvar[24m.

       The  [1munset [22mbuiltin also acts using the same dynamic scope: if a variable
       is local to the current scope, [1munset [22munsets it; otherwise the unset will
       refer to the variable found in any calling scope as described above.  If
       a variable at the current local scope is unset, it remains so (appearing
       as unset) until it is reset in that scope or until the function returns.
       Once the function returns, any instance of the variable  at  a  previous
       scope  becomes  visible.   If the unset acts on a variable at a previous
       scope, any instance of a variable with that name that had been  shadowed
       becomes  visible  (see below how the [1mlocalvar_unset [22mshell option changes
       this behavior).

       The [1mFUNCNEST [22mvariable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines
       a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed  the
       limit cause the entire command to abort.

       If  the  builtin  command [1mreturn [22mis executed in a function, the function
       completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function
       call.  If [1mreturn [22mis supplied a numeric argument, that is the  function's
       return status; otherwise the function's return status is the exit status
       of  the last command executed before the [1mreturn[22m.  Any command associated
       with the [1mRETURN [22mtrap is executed before execution resumes.  When a func‐
       tion completes, the values of the positional parameters and the  special
       parameter  [1m# [22mare restored to the values they had prior to the function's
       execution.

       The [1m-f [22moption to the [1mdeclare [22mor [1mtypeset [22mbuiltin commands lists  function
       names  and  definitions.   The [1m-F [22moption to [1mdeclare [22mor [1mtypeset [22mlists the
       function names only (and optionally the source file and line number,  if
       the  [1mextdebug  [22mshell  option  is enabled).  Functions may be exported so
       that child shell processes (those  created  when  executing  a  separate
       shell  invocation) automatically have them defined with the [1m-f [22moption to
       the [1mexport [22mbuiltin.  The [1m-f [22moption to the [1munset [22mbuiltin deletes a  func‐
       tion definition.

       Functions  may be recursive.  The [1mFUNCNEST [22mvariable may be used to limit
       the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number of function
       invocations.  By default, [1mbash [22mimposes no limit on the number of  recur‐
       sive calls.

[1mARITHMETIC EVALUATION[0m
       The  shell  allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain
       circumstances (see the [1mlet [22mand [1mdeclare [22mbuiltin commands, the [1m(( [22mcompound
       command, the arithmetic [1mfor [22mcommand, the  [1m[[  [22mconditional  command,  and
       [1mArithmetic Expansion[22m).

       Evaluation  is  done in the largest fixed-width integers available, with
       no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an
       error.  The operators and their precedence,  associativity,  and  values
       are  the  same as in the C language.  The following list of operators is
       grouped into levels  of  equal-precedence  operators.   The  levels  are
       listed in order of decreasing precedence.

       Shell  variables  are  allowed  as operands; parameter expansion is per‐
       formed before the expression is evaluated.  Within an expression,  shell
       variables may also be referenced by name without using the parameter ex‐
       pansion syntax.  This means you can use "x", where [4mx[24m is a shell variable
       name, in an arithmetic expression, and the shell will evaluate its value
       as  an  expression and use the result.  A shell variable that is null or
       unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by name in an expression.

       The value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when it
       is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the  [4minteger[24m  at‐
       tribute using [1mdeclare -i [22mis assigned a value.  A null value evaluates to
       0.  A shell variable need not have its [4minteger[24m attribute turned on to be
       used in an expression.

       Integer  constants follow the C language definition, without suffixes or
       character constants.  Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as  oc‐
       tal  numbers.   A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise, num‐
       bers take the form [[4mbase#[24m]n, where the optional [4mbase[24m is a decimal number
       between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and [4mn[24m is a number  in
       that  base.  If [4mbase#[24m is omitted, then base 10 is used.  When specifying
       [4mn[24m, if a non-digit is required, the digits greater than 9 are represented
       by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in  that  or‐
       der.   If [4mbase[24m is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase let‐
       ters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.

       Operators are evaluated in precedence order.  Sub-expressions in  paren‐
       theses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above.

[1mCONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS[0m
       Conditional expressions are used by the [1m[[ [22mcompound command and the [1mtest[0m
       and  [1m[  [22mbuiltin  commands to test file attributes and perform string and
       arithmetic comparisons.  The [1mtest [22mand [1m[ [22mcommands determine their  behav‐
       ior based on the number of arguments; see the descriptions of those com‐
       mands for any other command-specific actions.

       Expressions  are formed from the unary or binary primaries listed below.
       Unary expressions are often used to examine the  status  of  a  file  or
       shell variable.  Binary operators are used for string, numeric, and file
       attribute comparisons.

       [1mBash  [22mhandles  several filenames specially when they are used in expres‐
       sions.  If the operating system on which [1mbash [22mis running provides  these
       special files, bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate them inter‐
       nally  with  this behavior: If any [4mfile[24m argument to one of the primaries
       is of the form [4m/dev/fd/n[24m, then [1mbash [22mchecks file descriptor  [4mn[24m.   If  the
       [4mfile[24m argument to one of the primaries is one of [4m/dev/stdin[24m, [4m/dev/stdout[24m,
       or [4m/dev/stderr[24m, [1mbash [22mchecks file descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively.

       Unless  otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow sym‐
       bolic links and operate on the target of the link, rather than the  link
       itself.

       When used with [1m[[[22m, or when the shell is in posix mode, the [1m< [22mand [1m> [22moper‐
       ators  sort  lexicographically using the current locale.  When the shell
       is not in posix mode, the [1mtest [22mcommand sorts using ASCII ordering.

              less  than,  less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than
              or equal to [4marg2[24m, respectively.  [4marg1[24m and [4marg2[24m may be positive or
              negative integers.  When used with the [1m[[ [22mcommand, [4marg1[24m and  [4marg2[0m
              are  evaluated  as arithmetic expressions (see [1mARITHMETIC EVALUA‐[0m
              [1mTION [22mabove).  Since the expansions the  [1m[[  [22mcommand  performs  on
              [4marg1[24m and [4marg2[24m can potentially result in empty strings, arithmetic
              expression  evaluation  treats those as expressions that evaluate
              to 0.

[1mSIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION[0m
       When the shell executes a simple command, it performs the following  ex‐
       pansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right, in the fol‐
       lowing order.

       1.     The  words  that  the  parser  has marked as variable assignments
              (those preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for
              later processing.

       2.     The words that are not variable assignments or  redirections  are
              expanded.  If any words remain after expansion, the first word is
              taken  to  be the name of the command and the remaining words are
              the arguments.

       3.     Redirections are performed as described above under [1mREDIRECTION[22m.

       4.     The text after the [1m= [22min each variable assignment undergoes  tilde
              expansion,  parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
              expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to  the  vari‐
              able.

       If  no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current
       shell environment.  In the case of such a  command  (one  that  consists
       only  of  assignment statements and redirections), assignment statements
       are performed before redirections.  Otherwise, the variables  are  added
       to the environment of the executed command and do not affect the current
       shell environment.  If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value
       to  a  readonly  variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a
       non-zero status.

       If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do  not  af‐
       fect the current shell environment.  A redirection error causes the com‐
       mand to exit with a non-zero status.

       If  there  is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as
       described below.  Otherwise, the command exits.  If one  of  the  expan‐
       sions  contained  a command substitution, the exit status of the command
       is the exit status of the last command substitution performed.  If there
       were no command substitutions, the command exits with a zero status.

[1mCOMMAND EXECUTION[0m
       After a command has been split into words, if it  results  in  a  simple
       command  and  an optional list of arguments, the shell performs the fol‐
       lowing actions.

       If the command name contains no slashes, the shell  attempts  to  locate
       it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is in‐
       voked  as  described  above  in [1mFUNCTIONS[22m.  If the name does not match a
       function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a
       match is found, that builtin is invoked.

       If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and  contains  no
       slashes, [1mbash [22msearches each element of the [1mPATH [22mfor a directory contain‐
       ing an executable file by that name.  [1mBash [22muses a hash table to remember
       the  full  pathnames  of  executable files (see [1mhash [22munder [1mSHELL BUILTIN[0m
       [1mCOMMANDS [22mbelow).  Bash performs a full search of the directories in [1mPATH[0m
       only if the command is not found in the hash table.  If  the  search  is
       unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell function named [1mcom‐[0m
       [1mmand_not_found_handle[22m.  If that function exists, it is invoked in a sep‐
       arate  execution  environment with the original command and the original
       command's arguments as its arguments, and the function's exit status be‐
       comes the exit status of that subshell.  If that  function  is  not  de‐
       fined,  the  shell prints an error message and returns an exit status of
       127.

       If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more
       slashes, the shell executes the named program in  a  separate  execution
       environment.  Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining ar‐
       guments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.

       If  this  execution  fails because the file is not in executable format,
       and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a [4mshell[24m  [4mscript[24m,  a
       file  containing shell commands, and the shell creates a new instance of
       itself to execute it.  Bash tries to determine whether  the  file  is  a
       text  file  or  a binary, and will not execute files it determines to be
       binaries.  This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is  as
       if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the exception
       that  the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see [1mhash [22mbelow
       under [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mare retained by the child.

       If the program is a file beginning with [1m#![22m, the remainder of  the  first
       line  specifies  an interpreter for the program.  The shell executes the
       specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this  exe‐
       cutable  format themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of
       a single optional argument following the interpreter name on  the  first
       line  of  the  program, followed by the name of the program, followed by
       the command arguments, if any.

[1mCOMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT[0m
       The shell has an [4mexecution[24m [4menvironment[24m, which consists of the following:

       •      Open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as  modified  by
              redirections supplied to the [1mexec [22mbuiltin.

       •      The  current  working  directory as set by [1mcd[22m, [1mpushd[22m, or [1mpopd[22m, or
              inherited by the shell at invocation.

       •      The file creation mode mask as set by [1mumask [22mor inherited from the
              shell's parent.

       •      Current traps set by [1mtrap[22m.

       •      Shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with  [1mset[0m
              or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment.

       •      Shell  functions  defined  during execution or inherited from the
              shell's parent in the environment.

       •      Options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-
              line arguments) or by [1mset[22m.

       •      Options enabled by [1mshopt[22m.

       •      Shell aliases defined with [1malias[22m.

       •      Various process IDs, including  those  of  background  jobs,  the
              value of [1m$$[22m, and the value of [1mPPID[22m.

       When  a  simple  command other than a builtin or shell function is to be
       executed, it is invoked in a separate execution  environment  that  con‐
       sists  of  the following.  Unless otherwise noted, the values are inher‐
       ited from the shell.

       •      The shell's open files,  plus  any  modifications  and  additions
              specified by redirections to the command.

       •      The current working directory.

       •      The file creation mode mask.

       •      Shell variables and functions marked for export, along with vari‐
              ables exported for the command, passed in the environment.

       •      Traps  caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from
              the shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored.

       A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the shell's
       execution environment.

       A [4msubshell[24m is a copy of the shell process.

       Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses,  and  asynchro‐
       nous  commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a duplicate
       of the shell environment, except that traps caught by the shell are  re‐
       set  to  the  values that the shell inherited from its parent at invoca‐
       tion.  Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a  pipeline,  except
       possibly  in  the  last  element  depending on the value of the [1mlastpipe[0m
       shell option, are also executed in a subshell environment.  Changes made
       to the subshell environment cannot affect the shell's execution environ‐
       ment.

       When the shell is in posix mode, subshells spawned  to  execute  command
       substitutions  inherit  the  value  of  the  [1m-e [22moption from their parent
       shell.  When not in posix mode, [1mbash [22mclears the [1m-e [22moption in  such  sub‐
       shells.   See  the description of the [1minherit_errexit [22mshell option below
       for how to control this behavior when not in posix mode.

       If a command is followed by a [1m& [22mand job control is not active,  the  de‐
       fault  standard input for the command is the empty file [4m/dev/null[24m.  Oth‐
       erwise, the invoked command inherits the file descriptors of the calling
       shell as modified by redirections.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the [4men‐[0m
       [4mvironment[24m.  This is a list of [4mname[24m-[4mvalue[24m pairs, of the form [4mname[24m=[4mvalue[24m.

       The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment.  On invo‐
       cation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter  for
       each name found, automatically marking it for [4mexport[24m to child processes.
       Executed  commands inherit the environment.  The [1mexport[22m, [1mdeclare -x[22m, and
       [1munset [22mcommands modify the environment by adding and deleting  parameters
       and  functions.  If the value of a parameter in the environment is modi‐
       fied, the new value automatically becomes part of the  environment,  re‐
       placing the old.  The environment inherited by any executed command con‐
       sists  of  the shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified
       in the shell, less any pairs removed by the [1munset [22mor [1mexport -n [22mcommands,
       plus any additions via the [1mexport [22mand [1mdeclare -x [22mcommands.

       If any parameter assignments, as described above in  [1mPARAMETERS[22m,  appear
       before  a [4msimple[24m [4mcommand[24m, the variable assignments are part of that com‐
       mand's environment for as long as it executes.  These assignment  state‐
       ments  affect  only  the environment seen by that command.  If these as‐
       signments precede a call to a shell function, the variables are local to
       the function and exported to that function's children.

       If the [1m-k [22moption is set (see the [1mset [22mbuiltin command  below),  then  [4mall[0m
       parameter  assignments  are placed in the environment for a command, not
       just those that precede the command name.

       When [1mbash [22minvokes an external command, the variable [1m_ [22mis set to the full
       pathname of the command and passed to that command in its environment.

[1mEXIT STATUS[0m
       The exit status of an executed command is  the  value  returned  by  the
       [4mwaitpid[24m  system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses fall between
       0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may  use  values  above
       125  specially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands
       are also limited to this range.  Under certain circumstances, the  shell
       will use special values to indicate specific failure modes.

       For  the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status
       has succeeded.  So while an exit status of  zero  indicates  success,  a
       non-zero exit status indicates failure.

       When  a  command  terminates on a fatal signal [4mN[24m, [1mbash [22muses the value of
       128+[4mN[24m as the exit status.

       If a command is not found, the child process created to execute  it  re‐
       turns a status of 127.  If a command is found but is not executable, the
       return status is 126.

       If  a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection,
       the exit status is greater than zero.

       Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 ([4mtrue[24m)  if  successful,  and
       non-zero  ([4mfalse[24m)  if  an error occurs while they execute.  All builtins
       return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect  usage,  generally  in‐
       valid options or missing arguments.

       The  exit status of the last command is available in the special parame‐
       ter $?.

       [1mBash [22mitself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless
       a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits  with  a  non-zero  value.
       See also the [1mexit [22mbuiltin command below.

[1mSIGNALS[0m
       When  [1mbash  [22mis  interactive,  in  the  absence  of any traps, it ignores
       [1mSIGTERM [22m(so that [1mkill 0 [22mdoes not kill an interactive shell), and catches
       and handles [1mSIGINT [22m(so that the [1mwait [22mbuiltin  is  interruptible).   When
       [1mbash  [22mreceives  [1mSIGINT[22m,  it  breaks  out of any executing loops.  In all
       cases, [1mbash [22mignores [1mSIGQUIT[22m.  If job control is in effect, [1mbash  [22mignores
       [1mSIGTTIN[22m, [1mSIGTTOU[22m, and [1mSIGTSTP[22m.

       The  [1mtrap [22mbuiltin modifies the shell's signal handling, as described be‐
       low.

       Non-builtin commands [1mbash [22mexecutes have signal handlers set to the  val‐
       ues  inherited by the shell from its parent, unless [1mtrap [22msets them to be
       ignored, in which case the child process will ignore them as well.  When
       job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands  ignore  [1mSIGINT  [22mand
       [1mSIGQUIT  [22min addition to these inherited handlers.  Commands run as a re‐
       sult of command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated  job  control
       signals [1mSIGTTIN[22m, [1mSIGTTOU[22m, and [1mSIGTSTP[22m.

       The shell exits by default upon receipt of a [1mSIGHUP[22m.  Before exiting, an
       interactive  shell  resends  the [1mSIGHUP [22mto all jobs, running or stopped.
       The shell sends [1mSIGCONT [22mto stopped jobs to ensure that they receive  the
       [1mSIGHUP  [22m(see  [1mJOB  CONTROL  [22mbelow for more information about running and
       stopped jobs).  To prevent the shell from sending the signal to  a  par‐
       ticular  job, remove it from the jobs table with the [1mdisown [22mbuiltin (see
       [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow) or mark it not  to  receive  [1mSIGHUP  [22musing
       [1mdisown -h[22m.

       If  the  [1mhuponexit  [22mshell  option has been set using [1mshopt[22m, [1mbash [22msends a
       [1mSIGHUP [22mto all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

       If [1mbash [22mis waiting for a command to complete and receives a  signal  for
       which  a  trap has been set, it will not execute the trap until the com‐
       mand completes.  If [1mbash [22mis waiting for an asynchronous command via  the
       [1mwait  [22mbuiltin,  and  it receives a signal for which a trap has been set,
       the [1mwait [22mbuiltin will return immediately with  an  exit  status  greater
       than 128, immediately after which the shell executes the trap.

       When  job  control  is not enabled, and [1mbash [22mis waiting for a foreground
       command to complete, the shell receives keyboard-generated signals  such
       as  [1mSIGINT  [22m(usually generated by [1m^C[22m) that users commonly intend to send
       to that command.  This happens because the shell and the command are  in
       the  same  process  group  as  the  terminal, and [1m^C [22msends [1mSIGINT [22mto all
       processes in that process group.  Since [1mbash [22mdoes not enable job control
       by default when the shell is not interactive, this scenario is most com‐
       mon in non-interactive shells.

       When job control is enabled, and [1mbash [22mis waiting for a  foreground  com‐
       mand to complete, the shell does not receive keyboard-generated signals,
       because  it is not in the same process group as the terminal.  This sce‐
       nario is most common in interactive shells, where [1mbash [22mattempts  to  en‐
       able job control by default.  See [1mJOB CONTROL [22mbelow for more information
       about process groups.

       When  job control is not enabled, and [1mbash [22mreceives [1mSIGINT [22mwhile waiting
       for a foreground command, it waits until that foreground command  termi‐
       nates and then decides what to do about the [1mSIGINT[22m:

       1.     If  the command terminates due to the [1mSIGINT[22m, [1mbash [22mconcludes that
              the user meant to send the [1mSIGINT [22mto the shell as well, and  acts
              on  the [1mSIGINT [22m(e.g., by running a [1mSIGINT [22mtrap, exiting a non-in‐
              teractive shell, or returning to the top level to read a new com‐
              mand).

       2.     If the command does not terminate due to [1mSIGINT[22m, the program han‐
              dled the [1mSIGINT [22mitself and did not treat it as  a  fatal  signal.
              In  that  case, [1mbash [22mdoes not treat [1mSIGINT [22mas a fatal signal, ei‐
              ther, instead assuming that the [1mSIGINT [22mwas used as  part  of  the
              program's  normal operation (e.g., emacs uses it to abort editing
              commands) or deliberately discarded.  However, [1mbash [22mwill run  any
              trap  set  on [1mSIGINT[22m, as it does with any other trapped signal it
              receives while it is waiting for the foreground command  to  com‐
              plete, for compatibility.

       When  job  control  is enabled, [1mbash [22mdoes not receive keyboard-generated
       signals such as [1mSIGINT [22mwhile it is waiting for a foreground command.  An
       interactive shell does not pay attention to  the  [1mSIGINT[22m,  even  if  the
       foreground  command  terminates  as a result, other than noting its exit
       status.  If the shell is not interactive,  and  the  foreground  command
       terminates  due  to the [1mSIGINT[22m, [1mbash [22mpretends it received the [1mSIGINT [22mit‐
       self (scenario 1 above), for compatibility.

[1mJOB CONTROL[0m
       [4mJob[24m [4mcontrol[24m refers to the ability to selectively stop ([4msuspend[24m) the exe‐
       cution of processes and continue ([4mresume[24m) their  execution  at  a  later
       point.  A user typically employs this facility via an interactive inter‐
       face  supplied  jointly by the operating system kernel's terminal driver
       and [1mbash[22m.

       The shell associates a [4mjob[24m with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of cur‐
       rently executing jobs, which the [1mjobs [22mcommand will  display.   Each  job
       has  a  [4mjob[24m  [4mnumber[24m,  which [1mjobs [22mdisplays between brackets.  Job numbers
       start at 1.  When [1mbash [22mstarts a job asynchronously (in the  [4mbackground[24m),
       it prints a line that looks like:

              [1] 25647

       indicating  that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the
       last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647.  All  of
       the  processes  in  a single pipeline are members of the same job.  [1mBash[0m
       uses the [4mjob[24m abstraction as the basis for job control.

       To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to  job  control,
       each  process has a [4mprocess[24m [4mgroup[24m [4mID[24m, and the operating system maintains
       the notion of a  [4mcurrent[24m  [4mterminal[24m  [4mprocess[24m  [4mgroup[24m  [4mID[24m.   This  terminal
       process group ID is associated with the [4mcontrolling[24m [4mterminal[24m.

       Processes that have the same process group ID are said to be part of the
       same  [4mprocess[24m [4mgroup[24m.  Members of the [4mforeground[24m process group (processes
       whose process group ID is equal to the current  terminal  process  group
       ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as [1mSIGINT[22m.  Processes in the
       foreground  process  group  are  said to be [4mforeground[24m processes.  [4mBack‐[0m
       [4mground[24m processes are those whose process group ID differs from the  con‐
       trolling  terminal's;  such  processes  are immune to keyboard-generated
       signals.  Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or, if  the
       user so specifies with “stty tostop”, write to the controlling terminal.
       The  system  sends  a  [1mSIGTTIN  (SIGTTOU) [22msignal to background processes
       which attempt to read from (write to when “tostop”  is  in  effect)  the
       terminal, which, unless caught, suspends the process.

       If  the  operating system on which [1mbash [22mis running supports job control,
       [1mbash [22mcontains facilities to use it.  Typing the [4msuspend[24m character (typi‐
       cally [1m^Z[22m, Control-Z) while a process is running stops that  process  and
       returns  control  to  [1mbash[22m.  Typing the [4mdelayed[24m [4msuspend[24m character (typi‐
       cally [1m^Y[22m, Control-Y) causes the process stop when it  attempts  to  read
       input from the terminal, and returns control to [1mbash[22m.  The user then ma‐
       nipulates  the state of this job, using the [1mbg [22mcommand to continue it in
       the background, the [1mfg [22mcommand to continue it in the foreground, or  the
       [1mkill  [22mcommand  to  kill  it.  The suspend character takes effect immedi‐
       ately, and has the additional side effect of discarding any pending out‐
       put and typeahead.  To force a background process to  stop,  or  stop  a
       process that's not associated with the current terminal session, send it
       the [1mSIGSTOP [22msignal using [1mkill[22m.

       There  are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.  The [1m% [22mchar‐
       acter introduces a job specification (jobspec).

       Job number [4mn[24m may be referred to as [1m%n[22m.  A job may also  be  referred  to
       using  a  prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that
       appears in its command line.  For example, [1m%ce [22mrefers  to  a  job  whose
       command  name  begins with [1mce[22m.  Using [1m%?ce[22m, on the other hand, refers to
       any job containing the string [1mce [22min its command line.  If the prefix  or
       substring matches more than one job, [1mbash [22mreports an error.

       The symbols [1m%% [22mand [1m%+ [22mrefer to the shell's notion of the [4mcurrent[24m [4mjob[24m.  A
       single  %  (with  no  accompanying job specification) also refers to the
       current job.  [1m%- [22mrefers to the [4mprevious[24m [4mjob[24m.  When a job starts  in  the
       background,  a job stops while in the foreground, or a job is resumed in
       the background, it becomes the current job.  The job that was  the  cur‐
       rent job becomes the previous job.  When the current job terminates, the
       previous job becomes the current job.  If there is only a single job, [1m%+[0m
       and  [1m%-  [22mcan both be used to refer to that job.  In output pertaining to
       jobs (e.g., the output of the [1mjobs [22mcommand), the current job  is  always
       marked with a [1m+[22m, and the previous job with a [1m-[22m.

       Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: [1m%1 [22mis a
       synonym  for  “fg %1”, bringing job 1 from the background into the fore‐
       ground.  Similarly, “%1 &” resumes job 1 in the  background,  equivalent
       to “bg %1”.

       The  shell  learns  immediately whenever a job changes state.  Normally,
       [1mbash [22mwaits until it is about to print a prompt before notifying the user
       about changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output,
       though it will notify of changes in a job's status  after  a  foreground
       command  in  a  list completes, before executing the next command in the
       list.  If the [1m-b [22moption to the [1mset [22mbuiltin command is enabled, [1mbash  [22mre‐
       ports status changes immediately.  [1mBash [22mexecutes any trap on [1mSIGCHLD [22mfor
       each child that terminates.

       When  a job terminates and [1mbash [22mnotifies the user about it, [1mbash [22mremoves
       the job from the table.  It will not appear in  [1mjobs  [22moutput,  but  [1mwait[0m
       will report its exit status, as long as it's supplied the process ID as‐
       sociated with the job as an argument.  When the table is empty, job num‐
       bers start over at 1.

       If  a  user  attempts  to  exit  [1mbash [22mwhile jobs are stopped (or, if the
       [1mcheckjobs [22mshell option has been enabled using the  [1mshopt  [22mbuiltin,  run‐
       ning),  the shell prints a warning message, and, if the [1mcheckjobs [22moption
       is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses.   The  [1mjobs  [22mcommand  may
       then  be used to inspect their status.  If the user immediately attempts
       to exit again, without an intervening command, [1mbash [22mdoes not  print  an‐
       other warning, and terminates any stopped jobs.

       When  the  shell is waiting for a job or process using the [1mwait [22mbuiltin,
       and job control is enabled, [1mwait [22mwill return when the job changes state.
       The [1m-f [22moption causes [1mwait [22mto wait until the job  or  process  terminates
       before returning.

[1mPROMPTING[0m
       When  executing interactively, [1mbash [22mdisplays the primary prompt [1mPS1 [22mwhen
       it is ready to read a command, and the  secondary  prompt  [1mPS2  [22mwhen  it
       needs more input to complete a command.

       [1mBash [22mexamines the value of the array variable [1mPROMPT_COMMAND [22mjust before
       printing each primary prompt.  If any elements in [1mPROMPT_COMMAND [22mare set
       and  non-null, Bash executes each value, in numeric order, just as if it
       had been typed on the command line.  [1mBash [22mdisplays [1mPS0 [22mafter it reads  a
       command but before executing it.

       [1mBash  [22mdisplays  [1mPS4  [22mas described above before tracing each command when
       the [1m-x [22moption is enabled.

       [1mBash [22mallows the prompt strings [1mPS0[22m, [1mPS1[22m, [1mPS2[22m, and [1mPS4[22m, to be  customized
       by  inserting  a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are
       decoded as follows:

              [1m\a     [22mAn ASCII bell character (07).
              [1m\d     [22mThe date in “Weekday Month Date” format  (e.g.,  “Tue  May
                     26”).
              [1m\D{[4m[22mformat[24m[1m}[0m
                     The  [4mformat[24m is passed to [4mstrftime[24m(3) and the result is in‐
                     serted into the prompt string; an empty [4mformat[24m results  in
                     a locale-specific time representation.  The braces are re‐
                     quired.
              [1m\e     [22mAn ASCII escape character (033).

              [1m\l     [22mThe  basename  of  the shell's terminal device name (e.g.,
                     “ttys0”).
              [1m\n     [22mA newline.
              [1m\r     [22mA carriage return.
              [1m\s     [22mThe name of the shell: the basename  of  [1m$0  [22m(the  portion
                     following the final slash).
              [1m\t     [22mThe current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format.
              [1m\T     [22mThe current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format.
              [1m\@     [22mThe current time in 12-hour am/pm format.
              [1m\A     [22mThe current time in 24-hour HH:MM format.
              [1m\u     [22mThe username of the current user.
              [1m\v     [22mThe [1mbash [22mversion (e.g., 2.00).
              [1m\V     [22mThe [1mbash [22mrelease, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
              [1m\w     [22mThe value of the [1mPWD [22mshell variable ([1m$PWD[22m), with [1m$HOME [22mab‐
                     breviated  with a tilde (uses the value of the [1mPROMPT_DIR‐[0m
                     [1mTRIM [22mvariable).
              [1m\W     [22mThe basename of [1m$PWD[22m, with [1m$HOME [22mabbreviated with a tilde.
              [1m\!     [22mThe history number of this command.
              [1m\#     [22mThe command number of this command.
              [1m\$     [22mIf the effective UID is 0, a [1m#[22m, otherwise a [1m$[22m.
              [1m\[4m[22mnnn[24m   The character corresponding to the octal number [4mnnn[24m.

              [1m\[     [22mBegin a sequence of non-printing characters,  which  could
                     be  used  to  embed  a  terminal control sequence into the
                     prompt.
              [1m\]     [22mEnd a sequence of non-printing characters.

       The command number and the history number  are  usually  different:  the
       history  number  of a command is its position in the history list, which
       may include commands restored from the history file (see [1mHISTORY [22mbelow),
       while the command number is the position in the sequence of commands ex‐
       ecuted during the current shell session.  After the string  is  decoded,
       it is expanded via parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
       expansion,  and  quote  removal,  subject to the value of the [1mpromptvars[0m
       shell option (see the description  of  the  [1mshopt  [22mcommand  under  [1mSHELL[0m
       [1mBUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).  This can have unwanted side effects if escaped
       portions  of  the  string  appear within command substitution or contain
       characters special to word expansion.

[1mREADLINE[0m
       This is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive
       shell, unless the [1m--noediting [22moption is supplied  at  shell  invocation.
       Line  editing is also used when using the [1m-e [22moption to the [1mread [22mbuiltin.
       By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of  emacs;  a
       vi-style  line editing interface is also available.  Line editing can be
       enabled at any time using the [1m-o emacs [22mor  [1m-o  vi  [22moptions  to  the  [1mset[0m
       builtin  (see  [1mSHELL  BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).  To turn off line editing
       after the shell is running, use the [1m+o emacs [22mor [1m+o vi [22moptions to the [1mset[0m
       builtin.

   [1mReadline Notation[0m
       This section uses Emacs-style editing concepts and uses its notation for
       keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by C-[4mkey[24m,  e.g.,  C-n  means  Con‐
       trol-N.  Similarly, [4mmeta[24m keys are denoted by M-[4mkey[24m, so M-x means Meta-X.
       The Meta key is often labeled “Alt” or “Option”.

       On  keyboards  without  a [4mMeta[24m key, M-[4mx[24m means ESC [4mx[24m, i.e., press and re‐
       lease the Escape key, then press and release the  [4mx[24m  key,  in  sequence.
       This  makes  ESC  the [4mmeta[24m [4mprefix[24m.  The combination M-C-[4mx[24m means ESC Con‐
       trol-[4mx[24m: press and release the Escape key, then press and hold  the  Con‐
       trol key while pressing the [4mx[24m key, then release both.

       On  some  keyboards,  the Meta key modifier produces characters with the
       eighth bit (0200) set.  You can use the [1menable-meta-key [22mvariable to con‐
       trol whether or not it does this, if the keyboard allows  it.   On  many
       others, the terminal or terminal emulator converts the metafied key to a
       key sequence beginning with ESC as described in the preceding paragraph.

       If  your  [4mMeta[24m key produces a key sequence with the ESC meta prefix, you
       can make M-[4mkey[24m key bindings you specify (see [1mReadline Key  Bindings  [22mbe‐
       low) do the same thing by setting the [1mforce-meta-prefix [22mvariable.

       [1mReadline  [22mcommands may be given numeric [4marguments[24m, which normally act as
       a repeat count.  Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument that
       is significant.  Passing a negative argument to a command that  acts  in
       the  forward  direction  (e.g.,  [1mkill-line[22m)  makes that command act in a
       backward direction.  Commands whose  behavior  with  arguments  deviates
       from this are noted below.

       The  [4mpoint[24m  is  the  current cursor position, and [4mmark[24m refers to a saved
       cursor position.  The text between the point and mark is referred to  as
       the  [4mregion[24m.  [1mReadline [22mhas the concept of an [4mactive[24m [4mregion[24m: when the re‐
       gion is active, [1mreadline [22mredisplay highlights the region using the value
       of the  [1mactive-region-start-color  [22mvariable.   The  [1menable-active-region[0m
       variable  turns this on and off.  Several commands set the region to ac‐
       tive; those are noted below.

       When a command is described as [4mkilling[24m text, the text deleted  is  saved
       for  possible future retrieval ([4myanking[24m).  The killed text is saved in a
       [4mkill[24m [4mring[24m.  Consecutive kills accumulate the deleted text into one unit,
       which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text  sepa‐
       rate the chunks of text on the kill ring.

   [1mReadline Initialization[0m
       [1mReadline  [22mis  customized  by  putting commands in an initialization file
       (the [4minputrc[24m file).  The name of this file is taken from  the  value  of
       the  [1mINPUTRC  [22mshell variable.  If that variable is unset, the default is
       [4m~/.inputrc[24m.  If that file  does not exist or cannot  be  read,  [1mreadline[0m
       looks  for  [4m/etc/inputrc[24m.  When a program that uses the [1mreadline [22mlibrary
       starts up, [1mreadline [22mreads the initialization file and sets the key bind‐
       ings and variables found there, before reading any user input.

       There are only a few basic  constructs  allowed  in  the  inputrc  file.
       Blank  lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with a [1m# [22mare comments.  Lines
       beginning with a [1m$ [22mindicate conditional constructs.  Other lines  denote
       key bindings and variable settings.

       The  default key-bindings in this section may be changed using key bind‐
       ing commands in the [4minputrc[24m file.  Programs that use  the  [1mreadline  [22mli‐
       brary, including [1mbash[22m, may add their own commands and bindings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u: universal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u: universal-argument

       into  the  [4minputrc[24m would make M-C-u execute the [1mreadline [22mcommand [4muniver‐[0m
       [4msal-argument[24m.

       Key bindings may contain the following symbolic  character  names:  [4mDEL[24m,
       [4mESC[24m,  [4mESCAPE[24m,  [4mLFD[24m,  [4mNEWLINE[24m,  [4mRET[24m,  [4mRETURN[24m, [4mRUBOUT[24m (a destructive back‐
       space), [4mSPACE[24m, [4mSPC[24m, and [4mTAB[24m.

       In addition to command names, [1mreadline [22mallows keys  to  be  bound  to  a
       string  that is inserted when the key is pressed (a [4mmacro[24m).  The differ‐
       ence between a macro and a command is that a macro is enclosed in single
       or double quotes.

   [1mReadline Key Bindings[0m
       The syntax for controlling key bindings in the [4minputrc[24m file  is  simple.
       All  that  is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro
       and a key sequence to which it should be bound.  The key sequence may be
       specified in one of two ways: as a  symbolic  key  name,  possibly  with
       [4mMeta-[24m or [4mControl-[24m prefixes, or as a key sequence composed of one or more
       characters  enclosed  in  double  quotes.  The key sequence and name are
       separated by a colon.  There can be no whitespace between the  name  and
       the colon.

       When  using the form [1mkeyname[22m:[4mfunction-name[24m or [4mmacro[24m, [4mkeyname[24m is the name
       of a key spelled out in English.  For example:

              Control-u: universal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
              Control-o: "> output"

       In the above example, [4mC-u[24m is bound to the  function  [1muniversal-argument[22m,
       [4mM-DEL[24m  is  bound to the function [1mbackward-kill-word[22m, and [4mC-o[24m is bound to
       run the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to  insert  the
       text “> output” into the line).

       In the second form, [1m"keyseq"[22m:[4mfunction-name[24m or [4mmacro[24m, [1mkeyseq [22mdiffers from
       [1mkeyname  [22mabove  in  that  strings denoting an entire key sequence may be
       specified by placing the sequence within double quotes.  Some GNU  Emacs
       style  key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but none of
       the symbolic character names are recognized.

              "\C-u": universal-argument
              "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

       In this example, [4mC-u[24m is again bound to the function  [1muniversal-argument[22m.
       [4mC-x[24m  [4mC-r[24m  is bound to the function [1mre-read-init-file[22m, and [4mESC[24m [4m[[24m [4m1[24m [4m1[24m [4m~[24m is
       bound to insert the text “Function Key 1”.

       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences available when specify‐
       ing key sequences is
              [1m\C-    [22mA control prefix.
              [1m\M-    [22mAdding the meta prefix or converting the following charac‐
                     ter to a meta character, as described below  under  [1mforce-[0m
                     [1mmeta-prefix[22m.
              [1m\e     [22mAn escape character.
              [1m\\     [22mBackslash.
              [1m\"     [22mLiteral ", a double quote.
              [1m\'     [22mLiteral ', a single quote.

       In  addition  to  the  GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of
       backslash escapes is available:
              [1m\a     [22malert (bell)
              [1m\b     [22mbackspace
              [1m\d     [22mdelete
              [1m\f     [22mform feed
              [1m\n     [22mnewline
              [1m\r     [22mcarriage return
              [1m\t     [22mhorizontal tab
              [1m\v     [22mvertical tab
              [1m\[4m[22mnnn[24m   The eight-bit character whose value is the octal value [4mnnn[0m
                     (one to three digits).
              [1m\x[4m[22mHH[24m   The eight-bit character whose  value  is  the  hexadecimal
                     value [4mHH[24m (one or two hex digits).

       When  entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used
       to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to be a  func‐
       tion  name.   The  backslash escapes described above are expanded in the
       macro body.  Backslash quotes any other character in the macro text, in‐
       cluding " and '.

       [1mBash [22mwill display or modify the current [1mreadline [22mkey bindings  with  the
       [1mbind  [22mbuiltin command.  The [1m-o emacs [22mor [1m-o vi [22moptions to the [1mset [22mbuiltin

       active use.

   [1mReadline Variables[0m
       [1mReadline [22mhas variables that can be used to further customize its  behav‐
       ior.   A variable may be set in the [4minputrc[24m file with a statement of the
       form

              [1mset [4m[22mvariable-name[24m [4mvalue[0m
       or using the [1mbind [22mbuiltin command (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).

       Except where noted, [1mreadline [22mvariables can take the  values  [1mOn  [22mor  [1mOff[0m
       (without  regard  to  case).   Unrecognized  variable names are ignored.
       When [1mreadline [22mreads a variable value, empty or null values, “on”  (case-
       insensitive), and “1” are equivalent to [1mOn[22m.  All other values are equiv‐
       alent to [1mOff[22m.

       The [1mbind -V [22mcommand lists the current [1mreadline [22mvariable names and values
       (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow).

       The variables and their default values are:

       [1mactive-region-start-color[0m
              A  string  variable  that  controls the text color and background
              when displaying the text in the active region (see  the  descrip‐
              tion  of  [1menable-active-region [22mbelow).  This string must not take
              up any physical character positions on the display, so it  should
              consist  only  of terminal escape sequences.  It is output to the
              terminal before displaying the text in the active  region.   This
              variable is reset to the default value whenever the terminal type
              changes.   The default value is the string that puts the terminal
              in standout mode, as obtained from the  terminal's  terminfo  de‐
              scription.  A sample value might be “\e[01;33m”.
       [1mactive-region-end-color[0m
              A  string  variable  that  “undoes”  the  effects  of  [1mactive-re‐[0m
              [1mgion-start-color [22mand restores “normal” terminal  display  appear‐
              ance  after  displaying  text  in the active region.  This string
              must not take up any physical character positions on the display,
              so it should consist only of terminal escape  sequences.   It  is
              output  to  the  terminal after displaying the text in the active
              region.  This variable is reset to the default value whenever the
              terminal type changes.  The default value is the string that  re‐
              stores the terminal from standout mode, as obtained from the ter‐
              minal's terminfo description.  A sample value might be “\e[0m”.
       [1mbell-style (audible)[0m
              Controls  what  happens  when [1mreadline [22mwants to ring the terminal
              bell.  If set to [1mnone[22m, [1mreadline [22mnever rings the bell.  If set  to
              [1mvisible[22m,  [1mreadline  [22muses  a visible bell if one is available.  If
              set to [1maudible[22m, [1mreadline [22mattempts to ring the terminal's bell.
       [1mbind-tty-special-chars (On)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mattempts to bind  the  control  characters
              that  are  treated  specially  by the kernel's terminal driver to
              their [1mreadline [22mequivalents.  These override the default  [1mreadline[0m
              bindings  described here.  Type “stty -a” at a [1mbash [22mprompt to see
              your current terminal settings,  including  the  special  control
              characters (usually [1mcchars[22m).
       [1mblink-matching-paren (Off)[0m
              If  set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mattempts to briefly move the cursor to an
              opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is inserted.
       [1mcolored-completion-prefix (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, when listing  completions,  [1mreadline  [22mdisplays  the
              common  prefix of the set of possible completions using a differ‐
              ent color.  The color definitions are taken from the value of the
              [1mLS_COLORS [22menvironment variable.  If there is a  color  definition
              in  [1m$LS_COLORS  [22mfor  the custom suffix “.readline-colored-comple‐
              tion-prefix”, [1mreadline [22muses this color for the common prefix  in‐
              stead of its default.
       [1mcolored-stats (Off)[0m
              If  set  to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mdisplays possible completions using dif‐
              ferent colors to indicate their file type.  The color definitions
              are taken from the value of the [1mLS_COLORS [22menvironment variable.
       [1mcomment-begin ([22m“[1m#[22m”[1m)[0m
              The string that  the  [1mreadline  insert-comment  [22mcommand  inserts.
              This command is bound to [1mM-# [22min emacs mode and to [1m# [22min vi command
              mode.
       [1mcompletion-display-width (-1)[0m
              The  number  of  screen  columns used to display possible matches
              when performing completion.  The value is ignored if it  is  less
              than  0  or greater than the terminal screen width.  A value of 0
              causes matches to be displayed one per line.  The  default  value
              is -1.
       [1mcompletion-ignore-case (Off)[0m
              If  set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mperforms filename matching and completion
              in a case-insensitive fashion.
       [1mcompletion-map-case (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, and  [1mcompletion-ignore-case  [22mis  enabled,  [1mreadline[0m
              treats  hyphens  ([4m-[24m)  and underscores ([4m_[24m) as equivalent when per‐
              forming case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
       [1mcompletion-prefix-display-length (0)[0m
              The maximum length in characters of the common prefix of  a  list
              of  possible  completions that is displayed without modification.
              When set to a value greater than zero, [1mreadline  [22mreplaces  common
              prefixes  longer than this value with an ellipsis when displaying
              possible completions.  If a completion begins with a period,  and
              [1meadline  [22mis  completing  filenames, it uses three underscores in‐
              stead of an ellipsis.
       [1mcompletion-query-items (100)[0m
              This determines when the user is queried about viewing the number
              of possible completions  generated  by  the  [1mpossible-completions[0m
              command.   It  may  be  set  to any integer value greater than or
              equal to zero.  If the number of possible completions is  greater
              than  or  equal  to  the  value  of  this variable, [1mreadline [22masks
              whether or not the user wishes to view them;  otherwise  [1mreadline[0m
              simply  lists  them on the terminal.  A zero value means [1mreadline[0m
              should never ask; negative values are treated as zero.
       [1mconvert-meta (On)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mconverts characters it reads that have the
              eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by  clearing  the  eighth
              bit  and  prefixing  it  with an escape character (converting the
              character to have the meta prefix).  The default is [4mOn[24m, but [1mread‐[0m
              [1mline [22msets it to [4mOff[24m if the locale contains characters  whose  en‐
              codings may include bytes with the eighth bit set.  This variable
              is  dependent  on the [1mLC_CTYPE [22mlocale category, and may change if
              the locale changes.  This variable also affects key bindings; see
              the description of [1mforce-meta-prefix [22mbelow.
       [1mdisable-completion (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m,  [1mreadline  [22minhibits  word  completion.   Completion
              characters  are inserted into the line as if they had been mapped
              to [1mself-insert[22m.
       [1mecho-control-characters (On)[0m
              When set to [1mOn[22m, on operating systems that indicate  they  support
              it,  [1mreadline [22mechoes a character corresponding to a signal gener‐
              ated from the keyboard.
       [1mediting-mode (emacs)[0m
              Controls whether [1mreadline [22muses a set of key bindings  similar  to
              [4mEmacs[24m or [4mvi[24m.  [1mediting-mode [22mcan be set to either [1memacs [22mor [1mvi[22m.
       [1memacs-mode-string (@)[0m
              If  the  [4mshow-mode-in-prompt[24m  variable is enabled, this string is
              displayed immediately before the last line of the primary  prompt
              when  emacs editing mode is active.  The value is expanded like a
              key binding, so the standard set of meta- and  control-  prefixes
              and  backslash  escape sequences is available.  The \1 and \2 es‐
              capes begin and end sequences of non-printing  characters,  which
              can  be  used  to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode
              string.
       [1menable-active-region (On)[0m
              When this variable is set to [4mOn[24m, [1mreadline [22mallows certain commands
              to designate the region as [4mactive[24m.  When the  region  is  active,
              [1mreadline [22mhighlights the text in the region using the value of the
              [1mactive-region-start-color  [22mvariable, which defaults to the string
              that enables the terminal's standout  mode.   The  active  region
              shows  the text inserted by bracketed-paste and any matching text
              found by incremental and non-incremental history searches.
       [1menable-bracketed-paste (On)[0m
              When set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mconfigures the terminal to  insert  each
              paste  into  the editing buffer as a single string of characters,
              instead of treating each character as if it had  been  read  from
              the  keyboard.   This is called [4mbracketed-paste[24m [4mmode[24m; it prevents
              [1mreadline [22mfrom executing any editing commands  bound  to  key  se‐
              quences appearing in the pasted text.
       [1menable-keypad (Off)[0m
              When  set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mtries  to enable the application keypad
              when it is called.  Some systems need this to  enable  the  arrow
              keys.
       [1menable-meta-key (On)[0m
              When  set  to  [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mtries to enable any meta modifier key
              the terminal claims to support.  On many terminals, the Meta  key
              is  used  to  send eight-bit characters; this variable checks for
              the terminal capability that indicates the  terminal  can  enable
              and disable a mode that sets the eighth bit of a character (0200)
              if  the Meta key is held down when the character is typed (a meta
              character).
       [1mexpand-tilde (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mperforms tilde expansion when it  attempts
              word completion.
       [1mforce-meta-prefix (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mmodifies its behavior when binding key se‐
              quences  containing \M- or Meta- (see [1mKey Bindings [22mabove) by con‐
              verting a key sequence of the form \M-[4mC[24m or  Meta-[4mC[24m  to  the  two-
              character   sequence   [1mESC   [4m[22mC[24m  (adding  the  meta  prefix).   If
              [1mforce-meta-prefix [22mis set to [1mOff [22m(the default), [1mreadline [22muses  the
              value  of  the [1mconvert-meta [22mvariable to determine whether to per‐
              form this conversion: if [1mconvert-meta [22mis  [1mOn[22m,  [1mreadline  [22mperforms
              the conversion described above; if it is [1mOff[22m, [1mreadline [22mconverts [4mC[0m
              to a meta character by setting the eighth bit (0200).
       [1mhistory-preserve-point (Off)[0m
              If  set  to  [1mOn[22m,  the history code attempts to place point at the

              Set  the  maximum  number of history entries saved in the history
              list.  If set to zero, any existing history entries  are  deleted
              and  no new entries are saved.  If set to a value less than zero,
              the number of history entries is not limited.  By  default,  [1mbash[0m
              sets  the  maximum  number of history entries to the value of the
              [1mHISTSIZE [22mshell variable.  Setting [4mhistory-size[24m to  a  non-numeric
              value will set the maximum number of history entries to 500.
       [1mhorizontal-scroll-mode (Off)[0m
              Setting  this variable to [1mOn [22mmakes [1mreadline [22muse a single line for
              display, scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line
              when it becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping
              to a new line.  This setting is automatically enabled for  termi‐
              nals of height 1.
       [1minput-meta (Off)[0m
              If  set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22menables eight-bit input (that is, it does
              not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads),  regardless
              of  what the terminal claims it can support.  The default is [4mOff[24m,
              but [1mreadline [22msets it to [4mOn[24m  if  the  locale  contains  characters
              whose  encodings may include bytes with the eighth bit set.  This
              variable is dependent on the [1mLC_CTYPE [22mlocale  category,  and  its
              value  may change if the locale changes.  The name [1mmeta-flag [22mis a
              synonym for [1minput-meta[22m.
       [1misearch-terminators ([22m“[1mC-[C-j[22m”[1m)[0m
              The string of characters that  should  terminate  an  incremental
              search without subsequently executing the character as a command.
              If  this  variable has not been given a value, the characters [4mESC[0m
              and [1mC-j [22mterminate an incremental search.
       [1mkeymap (emacs)[0m
              Set the current [1mreadline [22mkeymap.  The set of valid  keymap  names
              is [4memacs,[24m [4memacs-standard,[24m [4memacs-meta,[24m [4memacs-ctlx,[24m [4mvi,[24m [4mvi-command[24m,
              and  [4mvi-insert[24m.  [4mvi[24m is equivalent to [4mvi-command[24m; [4memacs[24m is equiva‐
              lent to [4memacs-standard[24m.  The default value is [4memacs[24m; the value of
              [1mediting-mode [22malso affects the default keymap.
       [1mkeyseq-timeout (500)[0m
              Specifies the duration [1mreadline [22mwill wait for  a  character  when
              reading  an  ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a complete
              key sequence using the input read so far, or can take  additional
              input  to  complete a longer key sequence).  If [1mreadline [22mdoes not
              receive any input within the timeout, it  uses  the  shorter  but
              complete  key  sequence.  The value is specified in milliseconds,
              so a value of 1000 means that [1mreadline [22mwill wait one  second  for
              additional  input.   If this variable is set to a value less than
              or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value, [1mreadline [22mwaits until
              another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to complete.
       [1mmark-directories (On)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, completed directory names have a slash appended.
       [1mmark-modified-lines (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mdisplays history lines that have been mod‐
              ified with a preceding asterisk ([1m*[22m).
       [1mmark-symlinked-directories (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, completed names which are symbolic links to  direc‐
              tories have a slash appended, subject to the value of [1mmark-direc‐[0m
              [1mtories[22m.
       [1mmatch-hidden-files (On)[0m
              This  variable,  when  set  to [1mOn[22m, forces [1mreadline [22mto match files
              whose names begin with a  “.”   (hidden  files)  when  performing
              filename  completion.   If  set to [1mOff[22m, the user must include the
              leading “.”  in the filename to be completed.
       [1mmenu-complete-display-prefix (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, menu completion displays the common prefix  of  the
              list  of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling
              through the list.
       [1moutput-meta (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mdisplays characters with  the  eighth  bit
              set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.  The
              default is [4mOff[24m, but [1mreadline [22msets it to [4mOn[24m if the locale contains
              characters  whose encodings may include bytes with the eighth bit
              set.  This variable is dependent on the [1mLC_CTYPE [22mlocale category,
              and its value may change if the locale changes.
       [1mpage-completions (On)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22muses an internal pager resembling  [4mmore[24m(1)
              to display a screenful of possible completions at a time.

       [1mprint-completions-horizontally (Off)[0m
              If  set  to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mdisplays completions with matches sorted
              horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.
       [1mrevert-all-at-newline (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mwill undo all changes to history lines be‐
              fore returning when executing [1maccept-line[22m.  By  default,  history
              lines  may  be  modified  and retain individual undo lists across
              calls to [1mreadline[22m.
       [1msearch-ignore-case (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, [1mreadline [22mperforms incremental  and  non-incremental
              history list searches in a case-insensitive fashion.
       [1mshow-all-if-ambiguous (Off)[0m
              This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If
              set  to  [1mOn[22m,  words  which have more than one possible completion
              cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the
              bell.
       [1mshow-all-if-unmodified (Off)[0m
              This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a
              fashion similar to [1mshow-all-if-ambiguous[22m.  If set  to  [1mOn[22m,  words
              which have more than one possible completion without any possible
              partial completion (the possible completions don't share a common
              prefix)  cause  the  matches  to be listed immediately instead of
              ringing the bell.
       [1mshow-mode-in-prompt (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, add a string to the beginning of the  prompt  indi‐
              cating the editing mode: emacs, vi command, or vi insertion.  The
              mode strings are user-settable (e.g., [4memacs-mode-string[24m).
       [1mskip-completed-text (Off)[0m
              If  set  to  [1mOn[22m, this alters the default completion behavior when
              inserting a single match into the line.  It's  only  active  when
              performing completion in the middle of a word.  If enabled, [1mread‐[0m
              [1mline  [22mdoes  not  insert characters from the completion that match
              characters after point in the word being completed,  so  portions
              of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.
       [1mvi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))[0m
              If  the  [4mshow-mode-in-prompt[24m  variable is enabled, this string is
              displayed immediately before the last line of the primary  prompt
              when vi editing mode is active and in command mode.  The value is
              expanded  like  a  key  binding, so the standard set of meta- and
              control- prefixes and backslash escape  sequences  is  available.
              The  \1  and  \2  escapes begin and end sequences of non-printing
              characters, which can be used to embed  a  terminal  control  se‐
              quence into the mode string.
       [1mvi-ins-mode-string ((ins))[0m
              If  the  [4mshow-mode-in-prompt[24m  variable is enabled, this string is
              displayed immediately before the last line of the primary  prompt
              when  vi editing mode is active and in insertion mode.  The value
              is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta-  and
              control-  prefixes  and  backslash escape sequences is available.
              The \1 and \2 escapes begin and  end  sequences  of  non-printing
              characters,  which  can  be  used to embed a terminal control se‐
              quence into the mode string.
       [1mvisible-stats (Off)[0m
              If set to [1mOn[22m, a character denoting a file's type as  reported  by
              [4mstat[24m(2) is appended to the filename when listing possible comple‐
              tions.

   [1mReadline Conditional Constructs[0m
       [1mReadline [22mimplements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional com‐
       pilation  features  of  the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and
       variable settings to be performed as the result  of  tests.   There  are
       four parser directives available.

       [1m$if    [22mThe [1m$if [22mconstruct allows bindings to be made based on the editing
              mode, the terminal being used, or the application using [1mreadline[22m.
              The  text  of the test, after any comparison operator, extends to
              the end of the line; unless otherwise noted,  no  characters  are
              required to isolate it.

              [1mmode   [22mThe  [1mmode=  [22mform  of  the  [1m$if  [22mdirective  is used to test
                     whether [1mreadline [22mis in emacs or vi mode.  This may be used
                     in conjunction with the [1mset keymap [22mcommand, for  instance,
                     to  set  bindings  in  the  [4memacs-standard[24m  and [4memacs-ctlx[0m
                     keymaps only if [1mreadline [22mis starting out in emacs mode.

              [1mterm   [22mThe [1mterm= [22mform may be used  to  include  terminal-specific
                     key  bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by
                     the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right  side
                     of  the [1m= [22mis tested against both the full name of the ter‐
                     minal and the portion of  the  terminal  name  before  the
                     first  [1m-[22m.   This  allows  [4mxterm[24m  to  match  both [4mxterm[24m and
                     [4mxterm-256color[24m, for instance.

              [1mversion[0m
                     The [1mversion  [22mtest  may  be  used  to  perform  comparisons
                     against  specific  [1mreadline [22mversions.  The [1mversion [22mexpands
                     to the current [1mreadline [22mversion.  The  set  of  comparison
                     operators includes [1m=[22m, (and [1m==[22m), [1m!=[22m, [1m<=[22m, [1m>=[22m, [1m<[22m, and [1m>[22m.  The
                     version  number supplied on the right side of the operator
                     consists of a major version number,  an  optional  decimal
                     point,  and an optional minor version (e.g., [1m7.1[22m).  If the
                     minor version is omitted, it defaults to [1m0[22m.  The  operator
                     may be separated from the string [1mversion [22mand from the ver‐
                     sion number argument by whitespace.

              [4mapplication[0m
                     The  [4mapplication[24m construct is used to include application-
                     specific settings.  Each program using  the  [1mreadline  [22mli‐
                     brary  sets  the  [4mapplication[24m  [4mname[24m, and an initialization
                     file can test for a particular value.  This could be  used
                     to  bind  key sequences to functions useful for a specific
                     program.  For instance, the following command adds  a  key
                     sequence that quotes the current or previous word in [1mbash[22m:

                     [1m$if [22mBash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     [1m$endif[0m

              [4mvariable[0m
                     The  [4mvariable[24m construct provides simple equality tests for
                     [1mreadline [22mvariables and values.  The  permitted  comparison
                     operators  are  [4m=[24m,  [4m==[24m, and [4m!=[24m.  The variable name must be
                     separated from the comparison operator by whitespace;  the
                     operator may be separated from the value on the right hand
                     side  by  whitespace.  String and boolean variables may be
                     tested.  Boolean variables must be tested against the val‐
                     ues [4mon[24m and [4moff[24m.

       [1m$else  [22mCommands in this branch of the [1m$if [22mdirective are executed if  the
              test fails.

       [1m$endif [22mThis  command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an [1m$if[0m
              command.

       [1m$include[0m
              This directive takes a single filename as an argument  and  reads
              commands  and key bindings from that file.  For example, the fol‐
              lowing directive would read [4m/etc/inputrc[24m:

              [1m$include  [4m[22m/etc/inputrc[0m

   [1mSearching[0m
       [1mReadline [22mprovides commands for searching  through  the  command  history
       (see  [1mHISTORY [22mbelow) for lines containing a specified string.  There are
       two search modes: [4mincremental[24m and [4mnon-incremental[24m.

       Incremental searches begin before  the  user  has  finished  typing  the
       search  string.   As each character of the search string is typed, [1mread‐[0m
       [1mline [22mdisplays the next entry from the history matching the string  typed
       so  far.   An  incremental  search  requires  only as many characters as
       needed to find the desired history  entry.   When  using  emacs  editing
       mode,  type  [1mC-r  [22mto  search  backward  in  the history for a particular
       string.  Typing [1mC-s [22msearches forward through the history.   The  charac‐
       ters  present  in the value of the [1misearch-terminators [22mvariable are used
       to terminate an incremental search.  If that variable has not  been  as‐
       signed a value, [4mESC[24m and [1mC-j [22mterminate an incremental search.  [1mC-g [22maborts
       an  incremental  search and restores the original line.  When the search
       is terminated, the history entry containing the  search  string  becomes
       the current line.

       To  find  other matching entries in the history list, type [1mC-r [22mor [1mC-s [22mas
       appropriate.  This searches backward or forward in the history  for  the
       next  entry  matching the search string typed so far.  Any other key se‐
       quence bound to a [1mreadline [22mcommand terminates the  search  and  executes
       that command.  For instance, a newline terminates the search and accepts
       the  line, thereby executing the command from the history list.  A move‐
       ment command will terminate the search, make the  last  line  found  the
       current line, and begin editing.

       [1mReadline  [22mremembers the last incremental search string.  If two [1mC-r[22ms are
       typed without any intervening characters defining a new  search  string,
       [1mreadline [22muses any remembered search string.

       Non-incremental  searches  read the entire search string before starting
       to search for matching history entries.  The search string may be  typed
       by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

   [1mReadline Command Names[0m
       The following is a list of the names of the commands and the default key
       sequences  to which they are bound.  Command names without an accompany‐
       ing key sequence are unbound by default.

       In the following descriptions, [4mpoint[24m refers to the current cursor  posi‐
       tion,  and  [4mmark[24m  refers to a cursor position saved by the [1mset-mark [22mcom‐
       mand.  The text between the point and mark is referred to as the [4mregion[24m.
       [1mReadline [22mhas the concept of an [4mactive[24m [4mregion[24m: when the region is active,
       [1mreadline [22mredisplay highlights the region using  the  value  of  the  [1mac‐[0m
       [1mtive-region-start-color  [22mvariable.   The  [1menable-active-region  readline[0m
       variable turns this on and off.  Several commands set the region to  ac‐
       tive; those are noted below.

   [1mCommands for Moving[0m
       [1mbeginning-of-line (C-a)[0m

              Attempt  to  move point to the same physical screen column on the
              previous physical screen line.  This will not  have  the  desired
              effect  if  the  current [1mreadline [22mline does not take up more than
              one physical line or if point is not greater than the  length  of
              the prompt plus the screen width.
       [1mnext-screen-line[0m
              Attempt  to  move point to the same physical screen column on the
              next physical screen line.  This will not have the desired effect
              if the current [1mreadline [22mline does not take up more than one phys‐
              ical line or if the length of the current [1mreadline  [22mline  is  not

       [1mclear-display (M-C-l)[0m
              Clear  the  screen  and,  if  possible, the terminal's scrollback
              buffer, then redraw the current line, leaving the current line at
              the top of the screen.
       [1mclear-screen (C-l)[0m
              Clear the screen, then redraw the current line, leaving the  cur‐
              rent line at the top of the screen.  With a numeric argument, re‐
              fresh the current line without clearing the screen.
       [1mredraw-current-line[0m
              Refresh the current line.

   [1mCommands for Manipulating the History[0m
       [1maccept-line (Newline, Return)[0m
              Accept  the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line
              is non-empty, add it to the history list according to  the  state
              of  the  [1mHISTCONTROL  [22mand [1mHISTIGNORE [22mvariables.  If the line is a
              modified history line, restore the history line to  its  original
              state.
       [1mprevious-history (C-p)[0m
              Fetch  the previous command from the history list, moving back in
              the list.  This may also be bound to the up  arrow  key  on  some
              keyboards.
       [1mnext-history (C-n)[0m
              Fetch  the  next command from the history list, moving forward in
              the list.  This may also be bound to the down arrow key  on  some
              keyboards.
       [1mbeginning-of-history (M-<)[0m
              Move to the first line in the history.
       [1mend-of-history (M->)[0m
              Move  to  the  end of the input history, i.e., the line currently
              being entered.
       [1moperate-and-get-next (C-o)[0m
              Accept the current line for execution as if a  newline  had  been
              entered,  and  fetch  the  next line relative to the current line
              from the history for editing.  A numeric argument,  if  supplied,
              specifies the history entry to use instead of the current line.
       [1mfetch-history[0m
              With  a  numeric argument, fetch that entry from the history list
              and make it the current line.  Without an argument, move back  to
              the first entry in the history list.
       [1mreverse-search-history (C-r)[0m
              Search  backward  starting  at  the  current line and moving “up”
              through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.
              This command sets the region to the matched  text  and  activates
              the region.
       [1mforward-search-history (C-s)[0m
              Search  forward  starting  at  the current line and moving “down”
              through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.
              This command sets the region to the matched  text  and  activates
              the region.
       [1mnon-incremental-reverse-search-history (M-p)[0m
              Search  backward through the history starting at the current line
              using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the user.
              The search string may match anywhere in a history line.
       [1mnon-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n)[0m
              Search forward through the history using a non-incremental search
              for a string supplied by the user.  The search string  may  match
              anywhere in a history line.
       [1mhistory-search-backward[0m
              Search  backward through the history for the string of characters
              between the start of the current line and the point.  The  search
              string  must match at the beginning of a history line.  This is a
              non-incremental search.  This may be bound to the Page Up key  on
              some keyboards.
       [1mhistory-search-forward[0m
              Search  forward  through the history for the string of characters
              between the start of the current line and the point.  The  search
              string  must match at the beginning of a history line.  This is a
              non-incremental search.  This may be bound to the Page  Down  key
              on some keyboards.
       [1mhistory-substring-search-backward[0m
              Search  backward through the history for the string of characters
              between the start of the current line and the point.  The  search
              string  may  match anywhere in a history line.  This is a non-in‐
              cremental search.
       [1mhistory-substring-search-forward[0m
              Search forward through the history for the string  of  characters
              between  the start of the current line and the point.  The search
              string may match anywhere in a history line.  This is  a  non-in‐
              cremental search.
       [1myank-nth-arg (M-C-y)[0m
              Insert  the  first  argument to the previous command (usually the
              second word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument  [4mn[24m,
              insert  the  [4mn[24mth word from the previous command (the words in the
              previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument inserts
              the [4mn[24mth word from the end of the previous command.  Once the  ar‐
              gument  [4mn[24m is computed, this uses the history expansion facilities
              to extract the [4mn[24mth word, as if the  “![4mn[24m”  history  expansion  had
              been specified.
       [1myank-last-arg (M-., M-_)[0m
              Insert  the  last argument to the previous command (the last word
              of the previous history entry).  With a numeric argument,  behave
              exactly  like  [1myank-nth-arg[22m.   Successive  calls to [1myank-last-arg[0m
              move back through the history list, inserting the last  word  (or
              the  word  specified  by  the argument to the first call) of each
              line in turn.  Any numeric argument supplied to these  successive
              calls  determines  the  direction to move through the history.  A
              negative argument switches  the  direction  through  the  history
              (back or forward).  This uses the history expansion facilities to
              extract  the last word, as if the “!$” history expansion had been
              specified.
       [1mshell-expand-line (M-C-e)[0m
              Expand the line by performing shell word expansions.   This  per‐
              forms  alias and history expansion, [1m$[22m'[4mstring[24m' and [1m$[22m"[4mstring[24m" quot‐
              ing, tilde expansion, parameter and  variable  expansion,  arith‐
              metic  expansion,  command  and process substitution, word split‐
              ting, and quote removal.  An explicit argument suppresses command
              and process substitution.  See [1mHISTORY EXPANSION [22mbelow for a  de‐
              scription of history expansion.

   [1mCommands for Changing Text[0m
       [4mend-of-file[24m [1m(usually C-d)[0m
              The  character  indicating  end-of-file  as  set, for example, by
              [4mstty[24m(1).  If this character is read when there are no  characters
              on  the line, and point is at the beginning of the line, [1mreadline[0m
              interprets it as the end of input and returns [1mEOF[22m.
       [1mdelete-char (C-d)[0m
              Delete the character at point.  If this function is bound to  the
              same  character as the tty [1mEOF [22mcharacter, as [1mC-d [22mcommonly is, see
              above for the effects.  This may also be bound to the Delete  key
              on some keyboards.
       [1mbackward-delete-char (Rubout)[0m
              Delete the character behind the cursor.  When given a numeric ar‐
              gument, save the deleted text on the kill ring.
       [1mforward-backward-delete-char[0m
              Delete  the  character  under the cursor, unless the cursor is at
              the end of the line, in which case the character behind the  cur‐
              sor is deleted.
       [1mquoted-insert (C-q, C-v)[0m
              Add  the  next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how
              to insert characters like [1mC-q[22m, for example.
       [1mtab-insert (C-v TAB)[0m
              Insert a tab character.
       [1mself-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, [22m...[1m)[0m
              Insert the character typed.
       [1mbracketed-paste-begin[0m
              This function is intended to be bound to  the  “bracketed  paste”
              escape sequence sent by some terminals, and such a binding is as‐
              signed  by default.  It allows [1mreadline [22mto insert the pasted text
              as a single unit without treating each character  as  if  it  had
              been  read from the keyboard.  The pasted characters are inserted
              as if each one was bound to [1mself-insert [22minstead of executing  any
              editing commands.
              Bracketed  paste  sets  the region to the inserted text and acti‐
              vates the region.
       [1mtranspose-chars (C-t)[0m
              Drag the character before point forward  over  the  character  at
              point,  moving  point forward as well.  If point is at the end of
              the line, then this transposes the two characters  before  point.
              Negative arguments have no effect.
       [1mtranspose-words (M-t)[0m
              Drag  the  word  before  point  past the word after point, moving
              point past that word as well.  If point is  at  the  end  of  the
              line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
       [1mshell-transpose-words (M-C-t)[0m
              Drag  the  word  before  point  past the word after point, moving
              point past that word as well.  If the insertion point is  at  the
              end  of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
              Word  boundaries  are  the   same   as   [1mshell-forward-word   [22mand
              [1mshell-backward-word[22m.
       [1mupcase-word (M-u)[0m
              Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argu‐
              ment, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       [1mdowncase-word (M-l)[0m
              Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argu‐
              ment, lowercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       [1mcapitalize-word (M-c)[0m
              Capitalize  the current (or following) word.  With a negative ar‐
              gument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move point.
       [1moverwrite-mode[0m
              Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive  numeric  argu‐
              ment,  switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive
              numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This command  affects
              only  [1memacs  [22mmode; [1mvi [22mmode does overwrite differently.  Each call
              to [4mreadline()[24m starts in insert mode.
              In overwrite mode, characters bound to  [1mself-insert  [22mreplace  the
              text at point rather than pushing the text to the right.  Charac‐
              ters  bound  to [1mbackward-delete-char [22mreplace the character before
              point with a space.  By default, this command is unbound, but may
              be bound to the Insert key on some keyboards.

              Copy  the  word  following  point  to  the kill buffer.  The word
              boundaries are the same as [1mforward-word[22m.
       [1myank (C-y)[0m
              Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
       [1myank-pop (M-y)[0m
              Rotate the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works following
              [1myank [22mor [1myank-pop[22m.

   [1mNumeric Arguments[0m
       [1mdigit-argument (M-0, M-1, [22m...[1m, M--)[0m
              Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or  start  a
              new argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.
       [1muniversal-argument[0m
              This  is  another way to specify an argument.  If this command is
              followed by one or more digits, optionally with a  leading  minus
              sign,  those  digits define the argument.  If the command is fol‐
              lowed by digits, executing [1muniversal-argument [22magain ends the  nu‐
              meric  argument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special case, if
              this command is immediately followed by a character that is  nei‐
              ther a digit nor minus sign, the argument count for the next com‐
              mand is multiplied by four.  The argument count is initially one,
              so  executing  this  function  the  first time makes the argument
              count four, a second time makes the argument count  sixteen,  and
              so on.

   [1mCompleting[0m
       [1mcomplete (TAB)[0m
              Attempt to perform completion on the text before point.  [1mBash [22mat‐
              tempts  completion by first checking for any programmable comple‐
              tions for the command word (see [1mProgrammable  Completion  [22mbelow),
              otherwise  treating  the  text  as a variable (if the text begins
              with [1m$[22m), username (if the text begins with [1m~[22m), hostname  (if  the
              text  begins  with  [1m@[22m), or command (including aliases, functions,
              and builtins) in turn.  If none of these  produces  a  match,  it
              falls back to filename completion.
       [1mpossible-completions (M-?)[0m
              List  the  possible  completions  of the text before point.  When
              displaying completions, [1mreadline [22msets the number of columns  used
              for  display  to the value of [1mcompletion-display-width[22m, the value
              of the shell variable [1mCOLUMNS[22m, or the screen width, in  that  or‐
              der.
       [1minsert-completions (M-*)[0m
              Insert  all  completions of the text before point that would have
              been generated by [1mpossible-completions[22m, separated by a space.
       [1mmenu-complete[0m
              Similar to [1mcomplete[22m, but replaces the word to be completed with a
              single match from the list of possible  completions.   Repeatedly
              executing  [1mmenu-complete  [22msteps through the list of possible com‐
              pletions, inserting each match in turn.  At the end of  the  list
              of completions, [1mmenu-complete [22mrings the bell (subject to the set‐
              ting  of [1mbell-style[22m) and restores the original text.  An argument
              of [4mn[24m moves [4mn[24m positions forward in the list of matches; a negative
              argument moves backward through the list.  This  command  is  in‐
              tended to be bound to [1mTAB[22m, but is unbound by default.
       [1mmenu-complete-backward[0m
              Identical  to  [1mmenu-complete[22m, but moves backward through the list
              of possible completions, as if [1mmenu-complete  [22mhad  been  given  a
              negative argument.  This command is unbound by default.
       [1mexport-completions[0m
              Perform  completion  on  the word before point as described above
              and write the list of possible completions to  [1mreadline[22m's  output
              stream  using  the following format, writing information on sepa‐
              rate lines:

              •      the number of matches [4mN[24m;
              •      the word being completed;
              •      [4mS[24m:[4mE[24m, where [4mS[24m and [4mE[24m are the start and end  offsets  of  the
                     word in the [1mreadline [22mline buffer; then
              •      each match, one per line

              If  there  are  no  matches, the first line will be “0”, and this
              command does not print any output after the  [4mS[24m:[4mE[24m.   If  there  is
              only a single match, this prints a single line containing it.  If
              there  is  more  than one match, this prints the common prefix of
              the matches, which may be empty, on the first line after the [4mS[24m:[4mE[24m,
              then the matches on subsequent lines.  In this case, [4mN[24m  will  in‐
              clude the first line with the common prefix.

              The  user or application should be able to accommodate the possi‐
              bility of a blank line.  The intent is that the user or  applica‐
              tion  reads  [4mN[24m  lines after the line containing [4mS[24m:[4mE[24m to obtain the
              match list.  This command is unbound by default.

       [1mdelete-char-or-list[0m
              Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or
              end of the line (like [1mdelete-char[22m).  At the end of the  line,  it
              behaves identically to [1mpossible-completions[22m.  This command is un‐
              bound by default.

              effect unless explicitly bound to a [1mreadline [22mcommand, instead  of
              inserting  stray characters into the editing buffer.  This is un‐

              the characters at the beginning of the  line  do  not  match  the
              value  of  [1mcomment-begin[22m,  insert the value; otherwise delete the

              The  default  value  of [1mcomment-begin [22mcauses this command to make
              the current line a shell comment.  If a numeric  argument  causes
              the comment character to be removed, the line will be executed by
              the shell.

   [1mProgrammable Completion[0m
       When a user attempts word completion for a command or an argument  to  a
       command  for  which a completion specification (a [4mcompspec[24m) has been de‐
       fined using the [1mcomplete [22mbuiltin (see  [1mSHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  [22mbelow),
       [1mreadline [22minvokes the programmable completion facilities.

       First, [1mbash [22midentifies the command name.  If a compspec has been defined
       for  that command, the compspec is used to generate the list of possible
       completions for the word.  If the command word is the empty string (com‐
       pletion attempted at the beginning of an  empty  line),  [1mbash  [22muses  any
       compspec  defined with the [1m-E [22moption to [1mcomplete[22m.  The [1m-I [22moption to [1mcom‐[0m
       [1mplete [22mindicates that the command word is the first  non-assignment  word
       on  the line, or after a command delimiter such as [1m; [22mor [1m|[22m.  This usually
       indicates command name completion.

       If the command word is a full pathname, [1mbash [22msearches for a compspec for
       the full pathname first.  If there is no compspec for the full pathname,
       [1mbash [22mattempts to find a compspec for the  portion  following  the  final
       slash.  If those searches do not result in a compspec, or if there is no
       compspec  for  the command word, [1mbash [22muses any compspec defined with the
       [1m-D [22moption to [1mcomplete [22mas the default.  If there is no default  compspec,
       [1mbash [22mperforms alias expansion on the command word as a final resort, and
       attempts to find a compspec for the command word resulting from any suc‐
       cessful expansion.

       If  a compspec is not found, [1mbash [22mperforms its default completion as de‐
       scribed above under [1mCompleting[22m.  Otherwise, once  a  compspec  has  been
       found, [1mbash [22muses it to generate the list of matching words.

       First,  [1mbash  [22mperforms the [4mactions[24m specified by the compspec.  This only
       returns matches which are prefixes of the word  being  completed.   When
       the  [1m-f  [22mor [1m-d [22moption is used for filename or directory name completion,
       [1mbash [22muses the shell variable [1mFIGNORE [22mto filter the matches.

       Next, programmable completion generates matches specified by a  pathname
       expansion  pattern  supplied as an argument to the [1m-G [22moption.  The words
       generated by the pattern need not match the word being completed.   [1mBash[0m
       uses  the  [1mFIGNORE  [22mvariable to filter the matches, but does not use the
       [1mGLOBIGNORE [22mshell variable.

       Next, completion considers the string specified as the argument  to  the
       [1m-W  [22moption.   The  string is first split using the characters in the [1mIFS[0m
       special variable as delimiters.  This honors shell  quoting  within  the
       string,  in  order to provide a mechanism for the words to contain shell
       metacharacters or characters in the value of [1mIFS[22m.  Each word is then ex‐
       panded using brace expansion, tilde expansion,  parameter  and  variable
       expansion,  command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, as described
       above under [1mEXPANSION[22m.  The results are split using the rules  described
       above  under  [1mWord  Splitting[22m.  The results of the expansion are prefix-
       matched against the word being completed, and the matching words  become
       possible completions.

       After  these  matches have been generated, [1mbash [22mexecutes any shell func‐
       tion or command specified with the [1m-F [22mand [1m-C [22moptions.  When the  command
       or   function   is  invoked,  [1mbash  [22massigns  values  to  the  [1mCOMP_LINE[22m,
       [1mCOMP_POINT[22m, [1mCOMP_KEY[22m, and [1mCOMP_TYPE [22mvariables as described  above  under
       [1mShell  Variables[22m.   If a shell function is being invoked, [1mbash [22malso sets
       the [1mCOMP_WORDS [22mand [1mCOMP_CWORD [22mvariables.  When the function  or  command
       is invoked, the first argument ([1m$1[22m) is the name of the command whose ar‐
       guments  are being completed, the second argument ([1m$2[22m) is the word being
       completed, and the third argument ([1m$3[22m) is the word  preceding  the  word
       being  completed  on the current command line.  There is no filtering of
       the generated completions against the word being completed; the function
       or command has complete freedom in generating the matches  and  they  do
       not need to match a prefix of the word.

       Any  function  specified with [1m-F [22mis invoked first.  The function may use
       any of the shell facilities, including the [1mcompgen [22mand [1mcompopt  [22mbuiltins
       described below, to generate the matches.  It must put the possible com‐
       pletions in the [1mCOMPREPLY [22marray variable, one per array element.

       Next, any command specified with the [1m-C [22moption is invoked in an environ‐
       ment equivalent to command substitution.  It should print a list of com‐
       pletions, one per line, to the standard output.  Backslash will escape a
       newline,  if  necessary.  These are added to the set of possible comple‐
       tions.

       After generating all of the possible completions, [1mbash [22mapplies any  fil‐
       ter  specified  with  the [1m-X [22moption to the completions in the list.  The
       filter is a pattern as used for pathname expansion; a [1m& [22min  the  pattern
       is  replaced with the text of the word being completed.  A literal [1m& [22mmay
       be escaped with a backslash; the backslash is removed before  attempting
       a  match.   Any  completion that matches the pattern is removed from the
       list.  A leading [1m! [22mnegates the pattern; in this case  [1mbash  [22mremoves  any
       completion  that  does  not match the pattern.  If the [1mnocasematch [22mshell
       option is enabled, [1mbash [22mperforms the match without regard to the case of
       alphabetic characters.

       Finally, programmable completion adds any prefix  and  suffix  specified
       with  the  [1m-P  [22mand [1m-S [22moptions, respectively, to each completion, and re‐
       turns the result to [1mreadline [22mas the list of possible completions.

       If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches,  and  the
       [1m-o  dirnames  [22moption  was supplied to [1mcomplete [22mwhen the compspec was de‐
       fined, [1mbash [22mattempts directory name completion.

       If the [1m-o plusdirs [22moption was supplied to [1mcomplete [22mwhen the compspec was
       defined, [1mbash [22mattempts directory name completion and adds any matches to
       the set of possible completions.

       By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is returned to
       the completion code as the full set of possible  completions.   The  de‐
       fault  [1mbash  [22mcompletions and the [1mreadline [22mdefault of filename completion
       are disabled.  If the [1m-o bashdefault [22moption  was  supplied  to  [1mcomplete[0m
       when  the  compspec  was defined, and the compspec generates no matches,
       [1mbash [22mattempts its default completions.  If  the  compspec  and,  if  at‐
       tempted,  the  default  [1mbash [22mcompletions generate no matches, and the [1m-o[0m
       [1mdefault [22moption was supplied to [1mcomplete [22mwhen the compspec  was  defined,
       programmable completion performs [1mreadline[22m's default completion.

       The  options  supplied  to [1mcomplete [22mand [1mcompopt [22mcan control how [1mreadline[0m
       treats the completions.  For instance, the  [4m-o[24m  [4mfullquote[24m  option  tells
       [1mreadline  [22mto  quote  the matches as if they were filenames.  See the de‐
       scription of [1mcomplete [22mbelow for details.

       When a compspec indicates that it wants directory name  completion,  the
       programmable  completion  functions  force [1mreadline [22mto append a slash to
       completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject to  the
       value  of the [1mmark-directories readline [22mvariable, regardless of the set‐
       ting of the [1mmark-symlinked-directories readline [22mvariable.

       There is some support for dynamically modifying  completions.   This  is
       most useful when used in combination with a default completion specified
       with [1mcomplete -D[22m.  It's possible for shell functions executed as comple‐
       tion  functions to indicate that completion should be retried by return‐
       ing an exit status of 124.  If a shell function returns 124, and changes
       the compspec associated with the command on which  completion  is  being
       attempted  (supplied  as  the  first  argument when the function is exe‐
       cuted), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an at‐
       tempt to find a new compspec for that command.   This  can  be  used  to
       build  a  set  of  completions  dynamically  as completion is attempted,
       rather than loading them all at once.

       For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs,  each  kept
       in  a  file  corresponding to the name of the command, the following de‐
       fault completion function would load completions dynamically:
              _completion_loader()
              {
                . "/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh" \
                  >/dev/null 2>&1 && return 124
              }
              complete -D -F _completion_loader \
                  -o bashdefault -o default

[1mHISTORY[0m
       When the [1m-o history [22moption to the [1mset [22mbuiltin is enabled, the shell pro‐
       vides access to the [4mcommand[24m [4mhistory[24m, the  list  of  commands  previously
       typed.  The value of the [1mHISTSIZE [22mvariable is used as the number of com‐
       mands  to  save  in a history list: the shell saves the text of the last
       [1mHISTSIZE [22mcommands (default 500).  The shell stores each command  in  the
       history  list  prior  to parameter and variable expansion (see [1mEXPANSION[0m
       above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to  the  values
       of the shell variables [1mHISTIGNORE [22mand [1mHISTCONTROL[22m.

       On startup, [1mbash [22minitializes the history list by reading history entries
       from  the file named by the [1mHISTFILE [22mvariable (default [4m~/.bash_history[24m).
       That file is referred to as the [4mhistory[24m [4mfile[24m.  The history file is trun‐
       cated, if necessary, to contain no more than the number of  history  en‐
       tries specified by the value of the [1mHISTFILESIZE [22mvariable.  If [1mHISTFILE‐[0m
       [1mSIZE  [22mis  unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value
       less than zero, the history file is not truncated.

       When the history file is read, lines beginning with the history  comment
       character  followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps
       for the following history line.  These timestamps  are  optionally  dis‐
       played  depending  on  the  value  of the [1mHISTTIMEFORMAT [22mvariable.  When
       present, history timestamps delimit history entries,  making  multi-line
       entries possible.

       When  a shell with history enabled exits, [1mbash [22mcopies the last [1m$HISTSIZE[0m
       entries from the history list to [1m$HISTFILE[22m.  If the [1mhistappend [22mshell op‐
       tion is enabled (see the description of [1mshopt [22munder [1mSHELL  BUILTIN  COM‐[0m
       [1mMANDS [22mbelow), [1mbash [22mappends the entries to the history file, otherwise it
       overwrites  the  history  file.  If [1mHISTFILE [22mis unset or null, or if the
       history file is unwritable, the history is not saved.  After saving  the
       history,  [1mbash  [22mtruncates the history file to contain no more than [1mHIST‐[0m
       [1mFILESIZE [22mlines as described above.

       If the [1mHISTTIMEFORMAT [22mvariable is set, the shell  writes  the  timestamp
       information  associated  with  each  history  entry to the history file,
       marked with the history comment character, so timestamps  are  preserved
       across  shell sessions.  This uses the history comment character to dis‐
       tinguish timestamps from other history  lines.   As  above,  when  using
       [1mHISTTIMEFORMAT[22m, the timestamps delimit multi-line history entries.

       The  [1mfc  [22mbuiltin command (see [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mbelow) will list or
       edit and re-execute a portion of the history list.  The [1mhistory  [22mbuiltin
       can  display or modify the history list and manipulate the history file.
       When using command-line editing, search commands are available  in  each
       editing mode that provide access to the history list.

       The  shell  allows  control over which commands are saved on the history
       list.  The [1mHISTCONTROL [22mand [1mHISTIGNORE [22mvariables are used to save only  a
       subset of the commands entered.  If the [1mcmdhist [22mshell option is enabled,
       the shell attempts to save each line of a multi-line command in the same
       history  entry,  adding semicolons where necessary to preserve syntactic
       correctness.  The [1mlithist [22mshell option modifies [1mcmdhist  [22mby  saving  the
       command  with embedded newlines instead of semicolons.  See the descrip‐
       tion of the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin below under [1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS [22mfor  infor‐
       mation on setting and unsetting shell options.

[1mHISTORY EXPANSION[0m
       The  shell  supports  a history expansion feature that is similar to the
       history expansion in [1mcsh[22m.  This section describes what  syntax  features
       are available.

       History  expansion is enabled by default for interactive shells, and can
       be disabled using the [1m+H [22moption to the [1mset [22mbuiltin  command  (see  [1mSHELL[0m
       [1mBUILTIN  COMMANDS [22mbelow).  Non-interactive shells do not perform history
       expansion by default, but it can be enabled with “set -H”.

       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the  input
       stream,  making  it  easy  to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a
       previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in  previous
       commands quickly.

       History  expansion  is  performed  immediately  after a complete line is
       read, before the shell breaks it into words, and is  performed  on  each
       line  individually.   The shell attempts to inform the history expansion
       functions about quoting still in effect from previous lines.

       It takes place in two parts.  The first is to  determine  which  history
       list entry to use during substitution.  The second is to select portions
       of that entry to include into the current one.

       The  entry  selected  from the history is the [4mevent[24m, and the portions of
       that entry that are acted upon are [4mwords[24m.  Various [4mmodifiers[24m are  avail‐
       able to manipulate the selected words.  The entry is split into words in
       the  same  fashion as when reading input, so that several [4mmetacharacter[24m-
       separated words surrounded by quotes are considered one word.  The [4mevent[0m
       [4mdesignator[24m selects the event, the optional [4mword[24m [4mdesignator[24m selects words
       from the event, and various optional [4mmodifiers[24m are available to  manipu‐
       late the selected words.

       History  expansions  are introduced by the appearance of the history ex‐
       pansion character, which is [1m! [22mby default.  History expansions may appear
       anywhere in the input, but do not nest.

       Only backslash ([1m\[22m) and single quotes can  quote  the  history  expansion
       character, but the history expansion character is also treated as quoted
       if  it  immediately precedes the closing double quote in a double-quoted
       string.

       Several characters inhibit history expansion if found  immediately  fol‐
       lowing  the  history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: space,
       tab, newline, carriage return, [1m=[22m, and the other shell metacharacters de‐
       fined above.

       There is a special abbreviation for substitution, active when the  [4mquick[0m
       [4msubstitution[24m  character  (described  above under [1mhistchars[22m) is the first
       character on the line.  It selects the previous history list entry,  us‐
       ing an event designator equivalent to [1m!![22m, and substitutes one string for
       another  in  that entry.  It is described below under [1mEvent Designators[22m.
       This is the only history expansion that does not begin with the  history
       expansion character.

       Several  shell  options settable with the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin will modify his‐
       tory expansion behavior (see the description of the  [1mshopt  [22mbuiltin  be‐
       low).and  If the [1mhistverify [22mshell option is enabled, and [1mreadline [22mis be‐
       ing used, history substitutions are not immediately passed to the  shell
       parser.   Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into the [1mreadline [22medit‐
       ing buffer for further modification.  If [1mreadline [22mis being used, and the
       [1mhistreedit [22mshell option is enabled, a failed history substitution is re‐
       loaded into the [1mreadline [22mediting buffer for correction.

       The [1m-p [22moption to the [1mhistory [22mbuiltin command shows what a history expan‐
       sion will do before using it.  The [1m-s [22moption to the [1mhistory [22mbuiltin will
       add commands to the end of the history list without  actually  executing
       them, so that they are available for subsequent recall.

       The  shell  allows control of the various characters used by the history
       expansion mechanism (see the description of [1mhistchars [22mabove under  [1mShell[0m
       [1mVariables[22m).   The  shell uses the history comment character to mark his‐
       tory timestamps when writing the history file.

   [1mEvent Designators[0m
       An event designator is a reference to an entry in the history list.  The
       event designator consists of the portion of the word beginning with  the
       history  expansion  character  and  ending  with  the word designator if
       present, or the end of the word.   Unless  the  reference  is  absolute,
       events are relative to the current position in the history list.

       [1m!      [22mStart  a  history  substitution, except when followed by a [1mblank[22m,
              newline, carriage return, =, or, when the [1mextglob [22mshell option is
              enabled using the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin, (.

              omitted  if  [4mstring[24m  is  followed  immediately  by a newline.  If
              [4mstring[24m is missing, this uses the  string  from  the  most  recent
              search; it is an error if there is no previous search string.
       [1m^[4m[22mstring1[24m[1m^[4m[22mstring2[24m[1m^[0m

              [4mstring1[24m with [4mstring2[24m.  Equivalent to “!!:s^[4mstring1[24m^[4mstring2[24m^” (see
              [1mModifiers [22mbelow).
       [1m!#     [22mThe entire command line typed so far.

   [1mWord Designators[0m
       Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.   They
       are  optional; if the word designator isn't supplied, the history expan‐
       sion uses the entire event.  A [1m: [22mseparates the event specification  from
       the  word  designator.   It may be omitted if the word designator begins
       with a [1m^[22m, [1m$[22m, [1m*[22m, [1m-[22m, or [1m%[22m.  Words are numbered from the beginning  of  the
       line, with the first word being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted
       into the current line separated by single spaces.

       [1m0 (zero)[0m
              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
       [4mn[24m      The [4mn[24mth word.
       [1m^      [22mThe first argument: word 1.
       [1m$      [22mThe  last  word.  This is usually the last argument, but will ex‐
              pand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.
       [1m%      [22mThe first word matched by the most recent “?[4mstring[24m?”  search,  if
              the search string begins with a character that is part of a word.
              By default, searches begin at the end of each line and proceed to
              the  beginning,  so  the first word matched is the one closest to
              the end of the line.
       [4mx[24m[1m-[4m[22my[24m    A range of words; “-[4my[24m” abbreviates “0-[4my[24m”.
       [1m*      [22mAll of the words but the zeroth.  This is a  synonym  for  “[4m1-$[24m”.
              It  is  not  an  error  to use [1m* [22mif there is just one word in the
              event; it expands to the empty string in that case.
       [1mx*     [22mAbbreviates [4mx-$[24m.
       [1mx-     [22mAbbreviates [4mx-$[24m like [1mx*[22m, but omits the last word.  If [1mx [22mis  miss‐
              ing, it defaults to 0.

       If  a  word  designator  is supplied without an event specification, the
       previous command is used as the event, equivalent to [1m!![22m.

       After the optional word designator, the expansion may include a sequence
       of one or more of the following  modifiers,  each  preceded  by  a  “:”.
       These  modify,  or  edit,  the  word  or words selected from the history
       event.

       [1mh      [22mRemove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the head.
       [1mt      [22mRemove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.

       [1ms/[4m[22mold[24m[1m/[4m[22mnew[24m[1m/[0m
              Substitute [4mnew[24m for the first occurrence of [4mold[24m in the event line.
              Any character may be used as the delimiter in place  of  /.   The
              final  delimiter  is  optional if it is the last character of the
              event line.  A single backslash quotes the delimiter in  [4mold[24m  and
              [4mnew[24m.   If  &  appears  in [4mnew[24m, it is replaced with [4mold[24m.  A single
              backslash quotes the &.  If [4mold[24m is null, it is set  to  the  last
              [4mold[24m  substituted,  or,  if no previous history substitutions took
              place, the last [4mstring[24m in a [1m!?[4m[22mstring[24m[1m[?]  [22msearch.  If [4mnew[24m is null,

              used  with “[1m:s[22m”, any delimiter can be used in place of /, and the
              final delimiter is optional if it is the last  character  of  the
              event line.  An [1ma [22mmay be used as a synonym for [1mg[22m.
       [1mG      [22mApply  the following “[1ms[22m” or “[1m&[22m” modifier once to each word in the

[1mSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS[0m
       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this  section
       as  accepting options preceded by [1m- [22maccepts [1m-- [22mto signify the end of the
       options.  The [1m:[22m, [1mtrue[22m, [1mfalse[22m, and [1mtest[22m/[1m[ [22mbuiltins do not accept  options
       and  do  not  treat [1m-- [22mspecially.  The [1mexit[22m, [1mlogout[22m, [1mreturn[22m, [1mbreak[22m, [1mcon‐[0m
       [1mtinue[22m, [1mlet[22m, and [1mshift [22mbuiltins accept and  process  arguments  beginning
       with  [1m-  [22mwithout requiring [1m--[22m.  Other builtins that accept arguments but
       are not specified as accepting  options  interpret  arguments  beginning
       with [1m- [22mas invalid options and require [1m-- [22mto prevent this interpretation.

       [1m: [22m[[4marguments[24m]
              No  effect;  the  command does nothing beyond expanding [4marguments[0m
              and performing any specified redirections.  The return status  is
              zero.

       [1m. [22m[[1m-p [4m[22mpath[24m] [4mfilename[24m [[4marguments[24m]

              The  [1m.  [22mcommand ([1msource[22m) reads and execute commands from [4mfilename[0m
              in the current shell environment and returns the exit  status  of
              the last command executed from [4mfilename[24m.

              If  [4mfilename[24m does not contain a slash, [1m. [22msearches for it.  If the
              [1m-p [22moption is supplied, [1m. [22mtreats [4mpath[24m as a colon-separated list of
              directories in which to find [4mfilename[24m; otherwise, [1m. [22muses the  en‐

              in [1mPATH[22m, but does not search the current directory if [1m-p [22mis  sup‐
              plied.   If the [1msourcepath [22moption to the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin command is
              turned off, [1m. [22mdoes not search [1mPATH[22m.

              If any [4marguments[24m are supplied, they become the positional parame‐
              ters when [4mfilename[24m is executed.  Otherwise the positional parame‐
              ters are unchanged.

              If the [1m-T [22moption is enabled, [1m. [22minherits any trap on [1mDEBUG[22m; if  it
              is  not,  any  [1mDEBUG [22mtrap string is saved and restored around the
              call to [1m.[22m, and [1m. [22munsets the [1mDEBUG [22mtrap while it executes.  If  [1m-T[0m
              is  not set, and the sourced file changes the [1mDEBUG [22mtrap, the new
              value persists after [1m. [22mcompletes.  The return status is the  sta‐
              tus  of the last command executed from [4mfilename[24m (0 if no commands
              are executed), and non-zero if [4mfilename[24m is not found or cannot be
              read.

       [1malias [22m[[1m-p[22m] [[4mname[24m[=[4mvalue[24m] ...]
              With no arguments or with the [1m-p [22moption, [1malias [22mprints the list of
              aliases in the form [1malias [4m[22mname[24m=[4mvalue[24m on  standard  output.   When
              arguments are supplied, define an alias for each [4mname[24m whose [4mvalue[0m
              is  given.   A trailing space in [4mvalue[24m causes the next word to be
              checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded  during
              command parsing.  For each [4mname[24m in the argument list for which no
              [4mvalue[24m  is  supplied,  print the name and value of the alias [4mname[24m.
              [1malias [22mreturns true unless a [4mname[24m is given (without a  correspond‐

              its notion of the [4mcurrent[24m [4mjob[24m.  [1mbg [4m[22mjobspec[24m returns 0  unless  run

              abled, any specified [4mjobspec[24m was not found or was started without

              false if [4mshell-builtin[24m is not a shell builtin command.

       [1mcaller [22m[[4mexpr[24m]
              Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell  func‐
              tion or a script executed with the [1m. [22mor [1msource [22mbuiltins).

              Without [4mexpr[24m, [1mcaller [22mdisplays the line number and source filename
              of  the  current  subroutine  call.  If a non-negative integer is
              supplied as [4mexpr[24m, [1mcaller [22mdisplays  the  line  number,  subroutine
              name,  and source file corresponding to that position in the cur‐
              rent execution call stack.  This extra information may  be  used,
              for  example, to print a stack trace.  The current frame is frame
              0.

              The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a subrou‐
              tine call or [4mexpr[24m does not correspond to a valid position in  the

              Change the current directory to [4mdir[24m.  if [4mdir[24m is not supplied, the
              value  of  the  [1mHOME [22mshell variable is used as [4mdir[24m.  The variable
              [1mCDPATH [22mexists, and [4mdir[24m does not begin with a slash (/),  [1mcd  [22muses
              it  as  a  search path: the shell searches each directory name in
              [1mCDPATH [22mfor [4mdir[24m.  Alternative directory names in [1mCDPATH [22mare  sepa‐
              rated  by  a  colon  (:).  A null directory name in [1mCDPATH [22mis the
              same as the current directory, i.e., “.”.

              The [1m-P [22moption causes [1mcd [22mto use the physical  directory  structure
              by  resolving symbolic links while traversing [4mdir[24m and before pro‐
              cessing instances of [4m..[24m in [4mdir[24m (see also the [1m-P [22moption to the [1mset[0m
              builtin command).

              The [1m-L [22moption forces [1mcd [22mto follow symbolic links by resolving the
              link after processing instances of [4m..[24m in [4mdir[24m.  If [4m..[24m  appears  in
              [4mdir[24m,  [1mcd  [22mprocesses it by removing the immediately previous path‐
              name component from [4mdir[24m, back to a slash or the beginning of [4mdir[24m,
              and verifying that the portion of [4mdir[24m it has  processed  to  that
              point is still a valid directory name after removing the pathname
              component.   If  it  is  not a valid directory name, [1mcd [22mreturns a
              non-zero status.  If neither [1m-L [22mnor [1m-P [22mis supplied, [1mcd [22mbehaves as
              if [1m-L [22mhad been supplied.

              If the [1m-e [22moption is supplied with [1m-P[22m, and [1mcd [22mcannot  successfully
              determine the current working directory after a successful direc‐
              tory change, it returns a non-zero status.

              On  systems  that support it, the [1m-@ [22moption presents the extended
              attributes associated with a file as a directory.

              An argument of [1m- [22mis converted to [1m$OLDPWD  [22mbefore  attempting  the
              directory change.

              If [1mcd [22muses a non-empty directory name from [1mCDPATH[22m, or if [1m- [22mis the
              first argument, and the directory change is successful, [1mcd [22mwrites
              the  absolute  pathname of the new working directory to the stan‐
              dard output.

              If the directory change is successful, [1mcd [22msets the value  of  the
              [1mPWD  [22menvironment variable to the new directory name, and sets the
              [1mOLDPWD [22menvironment variable to the value of the  current  working
              directory before the change.

              The  return  value  is  true  if  the  directory was successfully
              changed; false otherwise.

       [1mcommand [22m[[1m-pVv[22m] [4mcommand[24m [[4marg[24m ...]
              The [1mcommand [22mbuiltin runs [4mcommand[24m with [4margs[24m suppressing the normal
              shell function lookup for [4mcommand[24m.  Only builtin commands or com‐
              mands found in the [1mPATH [22mnamed [4mcommand[24m are executed.   If  the  [1m-p[0m
              option  is  supplied, the search for [4mcommand[24m is performed using a
              default value for [1mPATH [22mthat is guaranteed  to  find  all  of  the
              standard utilities.

              If  either  the [1m-V [22mor [1m-v [22moption is supplied, [1mcommand [22mprints a de‐
              scription of [4mcommand[24m.  The [1m-v [22moption displays a single word indi‐
              cating the command or filename used to invoke [4mcommand[24m; the [1m-V [22mop‐
              tion produces a more verbose description.

              If the [1m-V [22mor [1m-v [22moption is supplied, the exit status  is  zero  if
              [4mcommand[24m  was  found,  and  non-zero if not.  If neither option is
              supplied and an error occurred or [4mcommand[24m cannot  be  found,  the
              exit  status  is  127.  Otherwise, the exit status of the [1mcommand[0m
              builtin is the exit status of [4mcommand[24m.

              [4moption[24ms, which may be any option accepted by the [1mcomplete [22mbuiltin
              with  the  exceptions  of  [1m-p[22m,  [1m-r[22m, [1m-D[22m, [1m-E[22m, and [1m-I[22m, and write the
              matches to the standard output.

              If the [1m-V [22moption is supplied, [1mcompgen [22mstores the  generated  com‐
              pletions into the indexed array variable [4mvarname[24m instead of writ‐
              ing them to the standard output.

              When  using the [1m-F [22mor [1m-C [22moptions, the various shell variables set
              by the programmable completion facilities, while available,  will
              not have useful values.

              The  matches will be generated in the same way as if the program‐
              mable completion code had generated them directly from a  comple‐
              tion  specification  with  the same flags.  If [4mword[24m is specified,
              only those completions matching [4mword[24m will be displayed or stored.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or
              no matches were generated.

              plied, print existing completion specifications in a way that al‐
              lows them to be reused as input.  The [1m-r [22moption removes a comple‐
              tion  specification  for each [4mname[24m, or, if no [4mname[24ms are supplied,
              all completion specifications.

              The [1m-D [22moption indicates that other supplied options  and  actions
              should  apply  to the “default” command completion; that is, com‐
              pletion attempted on a command for which no completion has previ‐
              ously been defined.  The [1m-E [22moption indicates that other  supplied
              options  and  actions should apply to “empty” command completion;
              that is, completion attempted on a blank line.  The [1m-I [22moption in‐
              dicates that other supplied options and actions should  apply  to
              completion on the initial non-assignment word on the line, or af‐
              ter  a command delimiter such as [1m; [22mor [1m|[22m, which is usually command
              name completion.  If multiple options are supplied, the [1m-D [22moption
              takes precedence over [1m-E[22m, and both take precedence over  [1m-I[22m.   If
              any  of  [1m-D[22m, [1m-E[22m, or [1m-I [22mare supplied, any other [4mname[24m arguments are
              ignored; these completions only apply to the  case  specified  by
              the option.

              The  process of applying these completion specifications when at‐
              tempting word completion  is described above  under  [1mProgrammable[0m

                      [4mcommand[24m  is  executed  in a subshell environment, and its
                      output is used as the  possible  completions.   Arguments
                      are passed as with the [1m-F [22moption.
              [1m-F [4m[22mfunction[0m
                      The  shell  function  [4mfunction[24m is executed in the current
                      shell environment.  When the function  is  executed,  the
                      first  argument ([1m$1[22m) is the name of the command whose ar‐
                      guments are being completed, the second argument ([1m$2[22m)  is
                      the  word being completed, and the third argument ([1m$3[22m) is
                      the word preceding the word being completed on  the  cur‐
                      rent  command line.  When [4mfunction[24m finishes, programmable
                      completion retrieves the possible  completions  from  the
                      value of the [1mCOMPREPLY [22marray variable.

                      word.  Shell quoting is honored within [4mwordlist[24m, in order
                      to provide a mechanism for the  words  to  contain  shell
                      metacharacters  or  characters  in the value of [1mIFS[22m.  The
                      possible completions are the  members  of  the  resultant
                      list which match a prefix of the word being completed.
              [1m-X [4m[22mfilterpat[0m
                      [4mfilterpat[24m  is  a  pattern as used for pathname expansion.
                      It is applied to the list of possible completions  gener‐
                      ated  by  the  preceding  options and arguments, and each
                      completion matching [4mfilterpat[24m is removed from  the  list.
                      A  leading  [1m!  [22min  [4mfilterpat[24m negates the pattern; in this
                      case, any completion not matching [4mfilterpat[24m is removed.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an
              option other than [1m-p[22m, [1m-r[22m, [1m-D[22m, [1m-E[22m, or [1m-I  [22mis  supplied  without  a
              [4mname[24m argument, an attempt is made to remove a completion specifi‐
              cation  for a [4mname[24m for which no specification exists, or an error
              occurs adding a completion specification.

       [1mcompopt [22m[[1m-o [4m[22moption[24m] [[1m-DEI[22m] [[1m+o [4m[22moption[24m] [[4mname[24m]
              Modify completion options for each [4mname[24m according to the [4moption[24ms,
              or for the currently-executing completion if no  [4mname[24ms  are  sup‐
              plied.   If  no  [4moption[24ms are supplied, display the completion op‐
              tions for each [4mname[24m or the current completion.  The possible val‐
              ues of [4moption[24m are those valid for the [1mcomplete [22mbuiltin  described
              above.

              The  [1m-D [22moption indicates that other supplied options should apply
              to the “default” command completion; the [1m-E [22moption indicates that
              other supplied options should apply to  “empty”  command  comple‐
              tion;  and  the  [1m-I  [22moption indicates that other supplied options
              should apply to completion on  the  initial  word  on  the  line.
              These are determined in the same way as the [1mcomplete [22mbuiltin.

              If  multiple options are supplied, the [1m-D [22moption takes precedence
              over [1m-E[22m, and both take precedence over [1m-I[22m.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an
              attempt is made to modify the options for a  [4mname[24m  for  which  no
              completion specification exists, or an output error occurs.

              enclosing  loop.  [4mn[24m must be ≥ 1.  If [4mn[24m is greater than the number
              of enclosing loops, the shell resumes  the  last  enclosing  loop
              (the  “top-level”  loop).   The return value is 0 unless [4mn[24m is not
              greater than or equal to 1.

              Declare variables and/or give them attributes.  If no  [4mname[24ms  are
              given  then display the values of variables or functions.  The [1m-p[0m
              option will display the attributes and values of each [4mname[24m.  When
              [1m-p [22mis used with [4mname[24m arguments, additional options, other than [1m-f[0m
              and [1m-F[22m, are ignored.

              When [1m-p [22mis supplied without [4mname[24m arguments, [1mdeclare [22mwill  display
              the  attributes and values of all variables having the attributes
              specified by the additional options.  If  no  other  options  are
              supplied  with [1m-p[22m, [1mdeclare [22mwill display the attributes and values
              of all shell variables.  The [1m-f [22moption restricts the  display  to
              shell functions.

              The  [1m-F [22moption inhibits the display of function definitions; only
              the function name and attributes are printed.   If  the  [1mextdebug[0m
              shell  option  is  enabled  using [1mshopt[22m, the source file name and
              line number where each [4mname[24m is defined  are  displayed  as  well.
              The [1m-F [22moption implies [1m-f[22m.

              The  [1m-g  [22moption forces variables to be created or modified at the
              global scope, even when [1mdeclare [22mis executed in a shell  function.
              It is ignored when [1mdeclare [22mis not executed in a shell function.

              The  [1m-I  [22moption  causes local variables to inherit the attributes
              (except the [4mnameref[24m attribute) and value of any existing variable
              with the same [4mname[24m at a surrounding scope.  If there is no exist‐
              ing variable, the local variable is initially unset.

              The following options can be used to restrict output to variables
              with the specified attribute or to give variables attributes:
              [1m-a     [22mEach [4mname[24m is an indexed array variable (see [1mArrays [22mabove).
              [1m-A     [22mEach [4mname[24m is an associative  array  variable  (see  [1mArrays[0m

              [1m-f     [22mEach [4mname[24m refers to a shell function.
              [1m-i     [22mThe  variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic evalua‐
                     tion (see [1mARITHMETIC EVALUATION [22mabove) is  performed  when
                     the variable is assigned a value.

              [1m-n     [22mGive  each  [4mname[24m  the  [4mnameref[24m attribute, making it a name
                     reference to another variable.  That other variable is de‐
                     fined by the value of [4mname[24m.  All references,  assignments,
                     and attribute modifications to [4mname[24m, except those using or
                     changing  the  [1m-n  [22mattribute  itself, are performed on the
                     variable referenced by  [4mname[24m's  value.   The  nameref  at‐
                     tribute cannot be applied to array variables.
              [1m-r     [22mMake  [4mname[24ms readonly.  These names cannot then be assigned
                     values by subsequent assignment statements or unset.
              [1m-t     [22mGive each [4mname[24m the [4mtrace[24m attribute.  Traced functions  in‐
                     herit  the  [1mDEBUG [22mand [1mRETURN [22mtraps from the calling shell.
                     The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.
              [1m-u     [22mWhen the variable is  assigned  a  value,  all  lower-case
                     characters  are  converted  to upper-case.  The lower-case

                     environment.

              Using  “+”  instead  of “-” turns off the specified attribute in‐
              stead, with the exceptions that [1m+a [22mand [1m+A [22mmay not be used to  de‐

              If  a variable name is followed by =[4mvalue[24m, the value of the vari‐

              If  the  [1m-h  [22moption  is supplied, [1mdisown [22mdoes not remove the jobs
              corresponding to each [4mid[24m from the jobs table,  but  rather  marks

              Enable  and  disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin
              allows an executable file which has the  same  name  as  a  shell
              builtin  to  be executed without specifying a full pathname, even
              though the shell normally searches for builtins before files.

              If [1m-n [22mis supplied, each [4mname[24m is disabled;  otherwise,  [4mname[24ms  are
              enabled.   For  example,  to use the [1mtest [22mbinary found using [1mPATH[0m
              instead of the shell builtin version, run “enable -n test”.

              If no [4mname[24m arguments are supplied, or if the [1m-p  [22moption  is  sup‐
              plied,  print a list of shell builtins.  With no other option ar‐
              guments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins.  If  [1m-n[0m
              is  supplied,  print  only disabled builtins.  If [1m-a [22mis supplied,
              the list printed includes all builtins,  with  an  indication  of
              whether  or not each is enabled.  The [1m-s [22moption means to restrict
              the output to the POSIX [4mspecial[24m builtins.

              The [1m-f [22moption means to load the new  builtin  command  [4mname[24m  from
              shared  object [4mfilename[24m, on systems that support dynamic loading.
              If [4mfilename[24m does not contain a slash, [1mBash [22mwill use the value  of
              the [1mBASH_LOADABLES_PATH [22mvariable as a colon-separated list of di‐
              rectories  in  which  to  search  for  [4mfilename[24m.  The default for
              [1mBASH_LOADABLES_PATH [22mis system-dependent, and may include  “.”  to
              force  a  search  of  the  current directory.  The [1m-d [22moption will
              delete a builtin previously loaded with [1m-f[22m.  If [4m-s[24m is  used  with
              [4m-f[24m, the new builtin becomes a POSIX special builtin.

              If no options are supplied and a [4mname[24m is not a shell builtin, [1men‐[0m
              [1mable  [22mwill  attempt to load [4mname[24m from a shared object named [4mname[24m,
              as if the command were “enable -f [4mname[24m [4mname[24m”.

              The return value is 0 unless a [4mname[24m is not  a  shell  builtin  or
              there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared object.

       [1meval [22m[[4marg[24m ...]
              Concatenate  the  [4marg[24ms together into a single command, separating
              them with spaces.  [1mBash [22mthen reads and execute this command,  and
              returns  its  exit status as the return status of [1meval[22m.  If there
              are no [4margs[24m, or only null arguments, [1meval [22mreturns 0.

              If [4mcommand[24m is specified, it replaces the shell without creating a
              new process.  [4mcommand[24m cannot be a shell builtin or function.  The
              [4marguments[24m become the arguments to [4mcommand[24m.  If the [1m-l  [22moption  is
              supplied,  the shell places a dash at the beginning of the zeroth
              argument passed to [4mcommand[24m.  This is what [4mlogin[24m(1) does.  The  [1m-c[0m
              option  causes  [4mcommand[24m to be executed with an empty environment.
              If [1m-a [22mis supplied, the shell passes [4mname[24m as the  zeroth  argument
              to the executed command.

              If  [4mcommand[24m cannot be executed for some reason, a non-interactive
              shell exits, unless the [1mexecfail [22mshell  option  is  enabled.   In
              that  case,  it  returns a non-zero status.  An interactive shell
              returns a non-zero status if the file cannot be executed.  A sub‐
              shell exits unconditionally if [1mexec [22mfails.

              If [4mcommand[24m is not specified, any redirections take effect in  the
              current  shell,  and the return status is 0.  If there is a redi‐
              rection error, the return status is 1.

       [1mexit [22m[[4mn[24m]
              Cause the shell to exit with a status of [4mn[24m.  If [4mn[24m is omitted, the
              exit status is that of the last command executed.   Any  trap  on
              [1mEXIT [22mis executed before the shell terminates.

              The  supplied  [4mnames[24m are marked for automatic export to the envi‐
              ronment of subsequently executed commands.  If the [1m-f  [22moption  is
              given, the [4mnames[24m refer to functions.

              The  [1m-n  [22moption  unexports, or removes the export attribute, from
              each [4mname[24m.  If no [4mnames[24m are given, or if only the  [1m-p  [22moption  is
              supplied,  [1mexport  [22mdisplays a list of names of all exported vari‐

              exported functions.  The [1m-p [22moption displays output in a form that

              This  sets the value of the variable to [4mvalue[24m while modifying the
              export attribute.  [1mexport [22mreturns an exit status of 0  unless  an
              invalid  option  is  encountered, one of the [4mnames[24m is not a valid

              The  first  form  selects  a range of commands from [4mfirst[24m to [4mlast[0m
              from the history list and displays or edits and re-executes them.
              [4mFirst[24m and [4mlast[24m may be specified as a string (to locate  the  last
              command beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into
              the  history  list,  where a negative number is used as an offset
              from the current command number).

              When listing, a [4mfirst[24m or [4mlast[24m of 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0  is
              equivalent  to the current command (usually the [1mfc [22mcommand); oth‐
              erwise 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is invalid.  If [4mlast[24m  is  not
              specified,  it is set to the current command for listing (so that
              “fc -l -10” prints the last 10 commands) and to [4mfirst[24m  otherwise.
              If  [4mfirst[24m is not specified, it is set to the previous command for
              editing and -16 for listing.

              If the [1m-l [22moption is supplied, the  commands  are  listed  on  the
              standard  output.   The  [1m-n [22moption suppresses the command numbers
              when listing.  The [1m-r [22moption reverses the order of the commands.

              Otherwise, [1mfc [22minvokes the editor named by [4mename[24m on  a  file  con‐
              taining  those  commands.   If [4mename[24m is not supplied, [1mfc [22muses the
              value of the [1mFCEDIT [22mvariable, and the value of [1mEDITOR  [22mif  [1mFCEDIT[0m
              is not set.  If neither variable is set, [1mfc [22muses [4mvi.[24m When editing
              is complete, [1mfc [22mreads the file containing the edited commands and
              echoes and executes them.

              In  the  second form, [1mfc [22mre-executes [4mcommand[24m after replacing each
              instance of [4mpat[24m with [4mrep[24m.  [4mCommand[24m is  interpreted  the  same  as
              [4mfirst[24m above.

              A  useful  alias to use with [1mfc [22mis “r="fc -s"”, so that typing “r
              cc” runs the last command beginning with “cc” and typing “r”  re-
              executes the last command.

              If the first form is used, the return value is zero unless an in‐
              valid  option  is  encountered  or  [4mfirst[24m or [4mlast[24m specify history
              lines out of range.  When editing and re-executing a file of com‐
              mands, the return value is the value of the last command executed
              or failure if an error occurs with the temporary  file.   If  the
              second form is used, the return status is that of the re-executed
              command,  unless  [4mcmd[24m  does not specify a valid history entry, in
              which case [1mfc [22mreturns a non-zero status.

       [1mfg [22m[[4mjobspec[24m]
              Resume [4mjobspec[24m in the foreground, and make it  the  current  job.
              If [4mjobspec[24m is not present, [1mfg [22muses the shell's notion of the [4mcur‐[0m
              [4mrent[24m  [4mjob[24m.   The  return value is that of the command placed into
              the foreground, or failure if run when job  control  is  disabled
              or,  when run with job control enabled, if [4mjobspec[24m does not spec‐
              ify a valid job or [4mjobspec[24m specifies a job that was started with‐
              out job control.

       [1mgetopts [4m[22moptstring[24m [4mname[24m [[4marg[24m ...]
              [1mgetopts [22mis used by shell scripts and  functions  to  parse  posi‐
              tional  parameters  and obtain options and their arguments.  [4mopt‐[0m
              [4mstring[24m contains the option characters  to  be  recognized;  if  a
              character  is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have
              an argument, which should be separated from it  by  white  space.
              The  colon and question mark characters may not be used as option
              characters.

              Each time it is invoked, [1mgetopts [22mplaces the next  option  in  the
              shell  variable [4mname[24m, initializing [4mname[24m if it does not exist, and
              the index of the next argument to be processed into the  variable
              [1mOPTIND[22m.   [1mOPTIND  [22mis  initialized  to  1 each time the shell or a
              shell script is invoked.  When an option  requires  an  argument,
              [1mgetopts [22mplaces that argument into the variable [1mOPTARG[22m.

              The  shell  does not reset [1mOPTIND [22mautomatically; it must be manu‐
              ally reset between multiple calls  to  [1mgetopts  [22mwithin  the  same
              shell invocation to use a new set of parameters.

              When  it  reaches the end of options, [1mgetopts [22mexits with a return
              value greater than zero.  [1mOPTIND [22mis set to the index of the first
              non-option argument, and [4mname[24m is set to ?.

              [1mgetopts [22mnormally parses the positional parameters,  but  if  more
              arguments  are  supplied  as [4marg[24m values, [1mgetopts [22mparses those in‐
              stead.

              [1mgetopts [22mcan report errors in two ways.  If the first character of
              [4moptstring[24m is a colon, [1mgetopts [22muses [4msilent[24m  error  reporting.   In
              normal  operation, [1mgetopts [22mprints diagnostic messages when it en‐
              counters invalid options or missing  option  arguments.   If  the
              variable  [1mOPTERR  [22mis set to 0, [1mgetopts [22mdoes not display any error
              messages, even if the first  character  of  [4moptstring[24m  is  not  a
              colon.

              If  [1mgetopts [22mdetects an invalid option, it places ? into [4mname[24m and,
              if not silent, prints an error message  and  unsets  [1mOPTARG[22m.   If
              [1mgetopts  [22mis  silent, it assigns the option character found to [1mOP‐[0m
              [1mTARG [22mand does not print a diagnostic message.

              If a required argument is not found, and [1mgetopts [22mis  not  silent,
              it  sets the value of [4mname[24m to a question mark ([1m?[22m), unsets [1mOPTARG[22m,
              and prints a diagnostic message.  If [1mgetopts [22mis silent,  it  sets
              the  value  of  [4mname[24m to a colon ([1m:[22m) and sets [1mOPTARG [22mto the option
              character found.

              [1mgetopts [22mreturns true if an option, specified or  unspecified,  is
              found.   It returns false if the end of options is encountered or
              an error occurs.

              Each time [1mhash [22mis invoked, it remembers the full pathname of  the
              command [4mname[24m as determined by searching the directories in [1m$PATH[22m.
              Any  previously-remembered  pathname associated with [4mname[24m is dis‐
              carded.  If the [1m-p [22moption is supplied, [1mhash [22muses [4mfilename[24m as  the
              full pathname of the command.

              The  [1m-r  [22moption  causes  the shell to forget all remembered loca‐
              tions.  Assigning to the [1mPATH [22mvariable  also  clears  all  hashed
              filenames.   The  [1m-d [22moption causes the shell to forget the remem‐
              bered location of each [4mname[24m.

              If the [1m-t [22moption is supplied, [1mhash [22mprints the full pathname  cor‐
              responding to each [4mname[24m.  If multiple [4mname[24m arguments are supplied
              with  [1m-t[22m,  [1mhash  [22mprints  the [4mname[24m before the corresponding hashed

                     negative, it is interpreted as  relative  to  one  greater
                     than  the last history position, so negative indices count
                     back from the end of the  history,  and  an  index  of  -1
                     refers to the current [1mhistory -d [22mcommand.

              is encountered or an invalid [4mjobspec[24m is supplied.

              If  the [1m-x [22moption is supplied, [1mjobs [22mreplaces any [4mjobspec[24m found in

              named  by each [4mid[24m.  Each [4mid[24m may be a job specification [4mjobspec[24m or
              a process ID [4mpid[24m.  [4msigspec[24m is either  a  case-insensitive  signal
              name such as [1mSIGKILL [22m(with or without the [1mSIG [22mprefix) or a signal
              number;  [4msignum[24m  is a signal number.  If [4msigspec[24m is not supplied,
              then [1mkill [22msends [1mSIGTERM[22m.

              The [1m-l [22moption lists the signal names.  If any arguments are  sup‐
              plied  when [1m-l [22mis given, [1mkill [22mlists the names of the signals cor‐
              responding to the arguments, and the return  status  is  0.   The
              [4mexit_status[24m argument to [1m-l [22mis a number specifying either a signal
              number or the exit status of a process terminated by a signal; if
              it  is  supplied,  [1mkill [22mprints the name of the signal that caused
              the process to terminate.  [1mkill [22massumes that  process  exit  sta‐
              tuses  are  greater than 128; anything less than that is a signal
              number.  The [1m-L [22moption is equivalent to [1m-l[22m.

              [1mkill [22mreturns true if at least one signal was  successfully  sent,
              or false if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.

       [1mlet [4m[22marg[24m [[4marg[24m ...]
              Each [4marg[24m is evaluated as an arithmetic expression (see [1mARITHMETIC[0m
              [1mEVALUATION  [22mabove).   If the last [4marg[24m evaluates to 0, [1mlet [22mreturns
              1; otherwise [1mlet [22mreturns 0.

       [1mlocal [22m[[4moption[24m] [[4mname[24m[=[4mvalue[24m] ... | - ]
              For each argument, create a local variable named [4mname[24m and  assign
              it  [4mvalue[24m.   The [4moption[24m can be any of the options accepted by [1mde‐[0m
              [1mclare[22m.  When [1mlocal [22mis used within a function, it causes the vari‐
              able [4mname[24m to have a visible scope restricted to that function and
              its children.  It is an error to use  [1mlocal  [22mwhen  not  within  a
              function.

              If  [4mname[24m  is  -,  it  makes the set of shell options local to the
              function in which [1mlocal [22mis invoked: any shell options changed us‐
              ing the [1mset [22mbuiltin inside the function after the call  to  [1mlocal[0m
              are  restored to their original values when the function returns.
              The restore is performed as if a series of [1mset [22mcommands were exe‐
              cuted to restore the values that were in place before  the  func‐
              tion.

              With  no  operands, [1mlocal [22mwrites a list of local variables to the
              standard output.

              The return status is 0 unless [1mlocal [22mis used outside  a  function,
              an invalid [4mname[24m is supplied, or [4mname[24m is a readonly variable.

              control  of  the [4mformat[24m.  The [1m-v [22moption assigns the output to the
              variable [4mvar[24m rather than printing it to the standard output.

              The [4mformat[24m is a character string which contains  three  types  of
              objects:  plain  characters,  which are simply copied to standard
              output, character  escape  sequences,  which  are  converted  and
              copied to the standard output, and format specifications, each of

                     the  format  string  uses the [4mprintf[24m alternate form, these

                     causes  [1mprintf  [22mto  output  the date-time string resulting
                     from using [4mdatefmt[24m as a  format  string  for  [4mstrftime[24m(3).
                     The  corresponding [4margument[24m is an integer representing the
                     number of seconds since the epoch.  This format  specifier
                     recognizes  two special argument values: -1 represents the
                     current time, and -2 represents the time the shell was in‐
                     voked.  If no argument is specified, conversion behaves as
                     if -1 had been supplied.  This  is  an  exception  to  the
                     usual [1mprintf [22mbehavior.

              The  %b, %q, and %T format specifiers all use the field width and
              precision arguments from the format specification and write  that
              many bytes from (or use that wide a field for) the expanded argu‐
              ment, which usually contains more characters than the original.

              The  %n format specifier accepts a corresponding argument that is
              treated as a shell variable name.

              The %s and %c format specifiers  accept  an  l  (long)  modifier,
              which  forces them to convert the argument string to a wide-char‐
              acter string and apply any supplied field width and precision  in
              terms  of characters, not bytes.  The %S and %C format specifiers
              are equivalent to %ls and %lc, respectively.

              Arguments to non-string format specifiers are treated as  C  con‐
              stants,  except that a leading plus or minus sign is allowed, and
              if the leading character is a single or double quote,  the  value
              is  the  numeric value of the following character, using the cur‐
              rent locale.

              The [4mformat[24m is reused as necessary to consume  all  of  the  [4margu‐[0m
              [4mments[24m.   If the [4mformat[24m requires more [4marguments[24m than are supplied,
              the extra format specifications behave as if a zero value or null
              string, as appropriate, had been supplied.  The return  value  is
              zero  on  success, non-zero if an invalid option is supplied or a
              write or assignment error occurs.

                      shell variable references in words to be completed.  This
                      means  that dollar signs in variable names that expand to
                      directories will not be quoted; however, any dollar signs
                      appearing in filenames will not be quoted, either.   This
                      is  active  only  when bash is using backslashes to quote

              0 arguments
                     The expression is false.
              1 argument
                     The expression is true if and only if the argument is  not
                     null.

                     above under [1mCONDITIONAL  EXPRESSIONS[22m,  the  expression  is
                     true  if the unary test is true.  If the first argument is
                     not a valid unary conditional operator, the expression  is
                     false.
              3 arguments
                     The  following conditions are applied in the order listed.
                     If the second argument is one of  the  binary  conditional
                     operators  listed above under [1mCONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS[22m, the
                     result of the expression is the result of the binary  test
                     using  the  first and third arguments as operands.  The [1m-a[0m
                     and [1m-o [22moperators  are  considered  binary  operators  when
                     there  are  three  arguments.  If the first argument is [1m![22m,
                     the value is the negation of the two-argument  test  using
                     the  second and third arguments.  If the first argument is
                     exactly [1m( [22mand the third argument is exactly [1m)[22m, the  result
                     is  the  one-argument test of the second argument.  Other‐
                     wise, the expression is false.
              4 arguments
                     The following conditions are applied in the order  listed.
                     If  the first argument is [1m![22m, the result is the negation of
                     the three-argument expression composed  of  the  remaining
                     arguments.   If  the  first  argument is exactly [1m( [22mand the
                     fourth argument is exactly [1m)[22m, the result is the  two-argu‐
                     ment  test  of the second and third arguments.  Otherwise,
                     the expression is parsed and evaluated according to prece‐
                     dence using the rules listed above.
              5 or more arguments
                     The expression is parsed and evaluated according to prece‐

              The historical operator-precedence parsing with 4 or  more  argu‐

              look like primaries.  The POSIX standard has  deprecated  the  [1m-a[0m

              Scripts should no longer use them.  It's much  more  reliable  to
              restrict  test  invocations  to  a single primary, and to replace
              uses of [1m-a [22mand [1m-o [22mwith the shell's [1m&& [22mand [1m|| [22mlist operators.

              The [4maction[24m is a command that is read and executed when the  shell
              receives  any  of  the signals [4msigspec[24m.  If [4maction[24m is absent (and
              there is a single [4msigspec[24m) or [1m-[22m, each specified [4msigspec[24m is  reset
              to the value it had when the shell was started.  If [4maction[24m is the
              null  string  the  signal specified by each [4msigspec[24m is ignored by
              the shell and by the commands it invokes.

              If no arguments are supplied, [1mtrap [22mdisplays the  actions  associ‐
              ated  with each trapped signal as a set of [1mtrap [22mcommands that can
              be reused as shell input to restore the current  signal  disposi‐
              tions.  If [1m-p [22mis given, and [4maction[24m is not present, then [1mtrap [22mdis‐
              plays  the  actions  associated with each [4msigspec[24m or, if none are
              supplied, for all trapped signals, as a set of [1mtrap [22mcommands that
              can be reused as shell input to restore the current signal dispo‐
              sitions.  The [1m-P [22moption behaves similarly, but displays only  the
              actions  associated  with  each [4msigspec[24m argument.  [1m-P [22mrequires at
              least one [4msigspec[24m argument.  The [1m-P [22mor [1m-p [22moptions may be used  in
              a  subshell environment (e.g., command substitution) and, as long
              as they are used before [1mtrap [22mis used to change  a  signal's  han‐
              dling, will display the state of its parent's traps.

              The [1m-l [22moption prints a list of signal names and their correspond‐
              ing  numbers.   Each  [4msigspec[24m  is either a signal name defined in
              <[4msignal.h[24m>, or a signal number.  Signal names are  case  insensi‐
              tive  and  the [1mSIG [22mprefix is optional.  If [1m-l [22mis supplied with no
              [4msigspec[24m arguments, it prints a list of valid signal names.

              If a [4msigspec[24m is [1mEXIT [22m(0), [4maction[24m is executed  on  exit  from  the
              shell.   If  a  [4msigspec[24m is [1mDEBUG[22m, [4maction[24m is executed before every
              [4msimple[24m [4mcommand[24m, [4mfor[24m command, [4mcase[24m  command,  [4mselect[24m  command,  ((
              arithmetic  command,  [[ conditional command, arithmetic [4mfor[24m com‐
              mand, and before the first command executes in a  shell  function
              (see  [1mSHELL  GRAMMAR  [22mabove).   Refer  to  the description of the
              [1mextdebug [22mshell option (see [1mshopt [22mabove) for details of its effect
              on the [1mDEBUG [22mtrap.  If a [4msigspec[24m is [1mRETURN[22m,  [4maction[24m  is  executed
              each  time  a  shell  function or a script executed with the [1m. [22mor
              [1msource [22mbuiltins finishes executing.

              If a [4msigspec[24m is [1mERR[22m,  [4maction[24m  is  executed  whenever  a  pipeline
              (which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a com‐
              pound command returns a non-zero exit status, subject to the fol‐
              lowing  conditions.   The  [1mERR [22mtrap is not executed if the failed
              command is part of the command list immediately following a [1mwhile[0m
              or [1muntil [22mreserved word, part of the test in an [4mif[24m statement, part
              of a command executed in a [1m&& [22mor [1m|| [22mlist except the command  fol‐
              lowing the final [1m&& [22mor [1m||[22m, any command in a pipeline but the last
              (subject  to  the  state of the [1mpipefail [22mshell option), or if the
              command's return value is being inverted using [1m![22m.  These are  the
              same conditions obeyed by the [1merrexit [22m([1m-e[22m) option.

              When  the shell is not interactive, signals ignored upon entry to
              the shell cannot be trapped or reset.  Interactive shells  permit
              trapping  signals ignored on entry.  Trapped signals that are not
              being ignored are reset to their original values in a subshell or
              subshell environment when one is created.  The return  status  is
              false if any [4msigspec[24m is invalid; otherwise [1mtrap [22mreturns true.

       [1mtrue   [22mDoes nothing, returns a 0 status.

       [1mtype [22m[[1m-aftpP[22m] [4mname[24m [[4mname[24m ...]
              Indicate  how each [4mname[24m would be interpreted if used as a command
              name.

              If the [1m-t [22moption is used, [1mtype [22mprints a string which  is  one  of
              [4malias[24m,  [4mkeyword[24m,  [4mfunction[24m, [4mbuiltin[24m, or [4mfile[24m if [4mname[24m is an alias,
              shell reserved word, function, builtin, or executable  file,  re‐
              spectively.   If  the  [4mname[24m is not found, [1mtype [22mprints nothing and
              returns a non-zero exit status.

              If the [1m-p [22moption is used, [1mtype [22meither returns the pathname of the
              executable file that would be found by searching [1m$PATH  [22mfor  [4mname[0m
              or  nothing  if “type -t name” would not return [4mfile[24m.  The [1m-P [22mop‐
              tion forces a [1mPATH [22msearch for each [4mname[24m, even if “type  -t  name”
              would not return [4mfile[24m.  If [4mname[24m is present in the table of hashed
              commands,  [1m-p  [22mand [1m-P [22mprint the hashed value, which is not neces‐
              sarily the file that appears first in [1mPATH[22m.

              If the [1m-a [22moption is used, [1mtype [22mprints all of the places that con‐
              tain a command  named  [4mname[24m.   This  includes  aliases,  reserved
              words,  functions,  and builtins, but the path search options ([1m-p[0m
              and [1m-P[22m) can be supplied to  restrict  the  output  to  executable
              files.   [1mtype  [22mdoes not consult the table of hashed commands when
              using [1m-a [22mwith [1m-p[22m, and only performs a [1mPATH [22msearch for [4mname[24m.

              The [1m-f [22moption suppresses shell function lookup, as with the  [1mcom‐[0m
              [1mmand  [22mbuiltin.   [1mtype  [22mreturns  true  if all of the arguments are
              found, false if any are not found.

       [1mulimit [22m[[1m-HS[22m] [1m-a[0m
       [1mulimit [22m[[1m-HS[22m] [[1m-bcdefiklmnpqrstuvxPRT [22m[[4mlimit[24m]]
              Provides control over the resources available to the shell and to
              processes it starts, on systems that allow such control.

              The [1m-H [22mand [1m-S [22moptions specify whether the hard or soft  limit  is
              set  for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased by
              a non-root user once it is set; a soft limit may be increased  up
              to  the  value of the hard limit.  If neither [1m-H [22mnor [1m-S [22mis speci‐
              fied, [1mulimit [22msets both the soft and hard limits.

              The value of [4mlimit[24m can be a number in the unit specified for  the
              resource  or  one of the special values [1mhard[22m, [1msoft[22m, or [1munlimited[22m,
              which stand for the current hard limit, the current  soft  limit,
              and  no  limit, respectively.  If [4mlimit[24m is omitted, [1mulimit [22mprints
              the current value of the soft limit of the resource,  unless  the
              [1m-H  [22moption  is  given.  When more than one resource is specified,
              the limit name and unit, if appropriate, are printed  before  the
              value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:

              If [4mlimit[24m is supplied, and the [1m-a [22moption is not used, [4mlimit[24m is the
              new value of the specified resource.  If no option  is  supplied,
              then [1m-f [22mis assumed.

              Values  are  in  1024-byte increments, except for [1m-t[22m, which is in

              values; and, when in posix mode, [1m-c [22mand [1m-f[22m, which are in 512-byte
              increments.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid  option  or
              argument  is  supplied,  or  an  error occurs while setting a new
              limit.

              Set the user file-creation mask to [4mmode[24m.  If [4mmode[24m begins  with  a
              digit,  it is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise it is in‐
              terpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar  to  that  accepted  by
              [4mchmod[24m(1).   If [4mmode[24m is omitted, [1mumask [22mprints the current value of
              the mask.  The [1m-S [22moption without a [4mmode[24m argument prints the  mask
              in  a symbolic format; the default output is an octal number.  If
              the [1m-p [22moption is supplied, and [4mmode[24m is omitted, the output is  in
              a form that may be reused as input.  The return status is zero if
              the mode was successfully changed or if no [4mmode[24m argument was sup‐
              plied, and non-zero otherwise.

              to wait for each [4mid[24m to terminate before returning its status, in‐
              stead of returning when it changes status.

              If none of the [4mid[24ms  specify  one  of  the  shell's  active  child
              processes, the return status is 127.  If [1mwait [22mis interrupted by a
              signal, any [4mvarname[24m will remain unset, and the return status will
              be  greater  than  128, as described under [1mSIGNALS [22mabove.  Other‐
              wise, the return status is the exit status of the last [4mid[24m.

[1mSHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE[0m
       Bash-4.0 introduced the concept of a [4mshell[24m [4mcompatibility[24m  [4mlevel[24m,  speci‐
       fied  as a set of options to the shopt builtin ([1mcompat31[22m, [1mcompat32[22m, [1mcom‐[0m
       [1mpat40[22m, [1mcompat41[22m, and so on).  There is only  one  current  compatibility
       level  —  each option is mutually exclusive.  The compatibility level is
       intended to allow users to select behavior from previous  versions  that
       is  incompatible  with  newer versions while they migrate scripts to use
       current features and behavior.  It's intended to be  a  temporary  solu‐
       tion.

       This section does not mention behavior that is standard for a particular
       version  (e.g.,  setting [1mcompat32 [22mmeans that quoting the right hand side
       of the regexp matching operator quotes special regexp characters in  the
       word, which is default behavior in bash-3.2 and subsequent versions).

       If  a  user  enables, say, [1mcompat32[22m, it may affect the behavior of other
       compatibility levels up  to  and  including  the  current  compatibility
       level.  The idea is that each compatibility level controls behavior that
       changed in that version of [1mbash[22m, but that behavior may have been present
       in  earlier versions.  For instance, the change to use locale-based com‐
       parisons with the [1m[[ [22mcommand came in bash-4.1, and earlier versions used
       ASCII-based comparisons, so enabling [1mcompat32  [22mwill  enable  ASCII-based
       comparisons  as  well.   That  granularity may not be sufficient for all
       uses, and as a result users should  employ  compatibility  levels  care‐
       fully.   Read the documentation for a particular feature to find out the
       current behavior.

       Bash-4.3 introduced a new shell variable: [1mBASH_COMPAT[22m.   The  value  as‐
       signed  to this variable (a decimal version number like 4.2, or an inte‐
       ger corresponding to the [1mcompat[4m[22mNN[24m option, like 42) determines  the  com‐
       patibility level.

       Starting  with bash-4.4, [1mbash [22mbegan deprecating older compatibility lev‐
       els.  Eventually, the options will be removed in favor of [1mBASH_COMPAT[22m.

       Bash-5.0 was the final version for which there was an  individual  shopt
       option  for  the previous version.  [1mBASH_COMPAT [22mis the only mechanism to
       control the compatibility level in versions newer than bash-5.0.

       The following table describes the behavior changes  controlled  by  each
       compatibility  level setting.  The [1mcompat[4m[22mNN[24m tag is used as shorthand for
       setting the compatibility level to [4mNN[24m using one of the following  mecha‐
       nisms.   For  versions prior to bash-5.0, the compatibility level may be
       set using the corresponding [1mcompat[4m[22mNN[24m shopt  option.   For  bash-4.3  and
       later  versions,  the  [1mBASH_COMPAT  [22mvariable is preferred, and it is re‐
       quired for bash-5.1 and later versions.

       [1mcompat31[0m
              •      Quoting the rhs of the [1m[[ [22mcommand's regexp matching opera‐
                     tor (=~) has no special effect.

       [1mcompat32[0m
              •      The [1m< [22mand [1m> [22moperators to the [1m[[ [22mcommand  do  not  consider
                     the  current locale when comparing strings; they use ASCII
                     ordering.

       [1mcompat40[0m
              •      The [1m< [22mand [1m> [22moperators to the [1m[[ [22mcommand  do  not  consider
                     the  current locale when comparing strings; they use ASCII
                     ordering.  [1mBash [22mversions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII  col‐
                     lation  and  [4mstrcmp[24m(3); bash-4.1 and later use the current
                     locale's collation sequence and [4mstrcoll[24m(3).

       [1mcompat41[0m
              •      In posix mode, [1mtime [22mmay be followed by options  and  still
                     be  recognized as a reserved word (this is POSIX interpre‐
                     tation 267).
              •      In [4mposix[24m mode, the parser requires that an even number  of
                     single quotes occur in the [4mword[24m portion of a double-quoted
                     parameter  expansion  and  treats  them specially, so that
                     characters within the single quotes are considered  quoted
                     (this is POSIX interpretation 221).

       [1mcompat42[0m
              •      The  replacement string in double-quoted pattern substitu‐
                     tion does not undergo quote removal, as it  does  in  ver‐
                     sions after bash-4.2.
              •      In  posix  mode, single quotes are considered special when
                     expanding the [4mword[24m portion of  a  double-quoted  parameter
                     expansion  and  can  be  used  to quote a closing brace or
                     other special character (this is part of POSIX interpreta‐
                     tion 221); in later versions, single quotes are  not  spe‐
                     cial within double-quoted word expansions.

       [1mcompat43[0m
              •      Word expansion errors are considered non-fatal errors that
                     cause the current command to fail, even in posix mode (the
                     default  behavior  is to make them fatal errors that cause
                     the shell to exit).
              •      When executing a shell function, the loop state (while/un‐
                     til/etc.)  is not reset, so  [1mbreak  [22mor  [1mcontinue  [22min  that
                     function  will break or continue loops in the calling con‐
                     text.  Bash-4.4 and later reset the loop state to  prevent
                     this.

       [1mcompat44[0m
              •      The  shell  sets  up  the  values  used  by  [1mBASH_ARGV [22mand

                     rameters even if extended debugging mode is not enabled.
              •      A subshell inherits loops  from  its  parent  context,  so
                     [1mbreak  [22mor  [1mcontinue  [22mwill  cause  the  subshell  to  exit.
                     Bash-5.0 and later reset the loop  state  to  prevent  the
                     exit
              •      Variable  assignments  preceding  builtins like [1mexport [22mand
                     [1mreadonly [22mthat set attributes continue to affect  variables
                     with  the same name in the calling environment even if the
                     shell is not in posix mode.

       [1mcompat50[0m
              •      Bash-5.1 changed the way [1m$RANDOM [22mis generated to introduce
                     slightly more  randomness.   If  the  shell  compatibility
                     level is set to 50 or lower, it reverts to the method from
                     bash-5.0 and previous versions, so seeding the random num‐
                     ber  generator by assigning a value to [1mRANDOM [22mwill produce
                     the same sequence as in bash-5.0.
              •      If the command hash table is empty, bash versions prior to
                     bash-5.1 printed an informational message to that  effect,
                     even  when  producing  output that can be reused as input.
                     Bash-5.1 suppresses that message when  the  [1m-l  [22moption  is
                     supplied.

       [1mcompat51[0m
              •      The  [1munset  [22mbuiltin  treats  attempts  to unset array sub‐

                     is indexed or associative, and differently than in  previ‐
                     ous versions.
              •      Arithmetic  commands ( [1m(([22m...[1m)) [22m) and the expressions in an
                     arithmetic for statement can be expanded more than once.
              •      Expressions used as arguments to arithmetic  operators  in
                     the [1m[[ [22mconditional command can be expanded more than once.
              •      The expressions in substring parameter brace expansion can
                     be expanded more than once.

              •      Arithmetic expressions used as  indexed  array  subscripts
                     can be expanded more than once.
              •      [1mtest -v[22m, when given an argument of [1mA[@][22m, where [1mA [22mis an ex‐
                     isting  associative  array,  will return true if the array
                     has any set elements.  Bash-5.2 will look for  and  report
                     on a key named [1m@[22m.
              •      The   ${[4mparameter[24m[1m[:]=[4m[22mvalue[24m}  word  expansion  will  return
                     [4mvalue[24m, before any variable-specific  transformations  have
                     been  performed (e.g., converting to lowercase).  Bash-5.2
                     will return the final value assigned to the variable.
              •      Parsing command substitutions will behave as  if  extended
                     globbing  (see the description of the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin above)
                     is enabled, so that parsing a  command  substitution  con‐
                     taining  an extglob pattern (say, as part of a shell func‐
                     tion) will not fail.  This assumes the intent is to enable
                     extglob before the command is executed and word expansions
                     are performed.  It will fail at  word  expansion  time  if
                     extglob hasn't been enabled by the time the command is ex‐
                     ecuted.

[1mRESTRICTED SHELL[0m
       If [1mbash [22mis started with the name [1mrbash[22m, or the [1m-r [22moption is supplied  at

       It's too big and too slow.

       There are some subtle differences between [1mbash [22mand traditional  versions
       of [1msh[22m, mostly because of the POSIX specification.

       Aliases are confusing in some uses.

       Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.

       Compound commands and command lists of the form “a ; b ; c” are not han‐
       dled  gracefully  when combined with process suspension.  When a process
       is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next command in the  list
       or breaks out of any existing loops.  It suffices to enclose the command
       in  parentheses  to  force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a
       unit, or to start the command in the background and immediately bring it
       into the foreground.

       Array variables may not (yet) be exported.
